  faq: {
    title: "Questions",
    items: [
      {
        question: "What is the mirroring process?",
        answer: "Mirroring is how we configure Kowalah Reserved to think like you. Over three months, we learn your language, your mental models, your decision-making frameworks, and how you approach problems. We connect your systems, build custom skills for your workflows, and train the AI on your terminology. The result is a strategic partner that feels like talking to yourself—one that already knows your context, your preferences, and your way of working."
      },
      {
        question: "How is this different from ChatGPT or Claude.ai?",
        answer: "Those are blank canvases. Kowalah Reserved is a mirror of your business and your thinking. It knows your context permanently, uses your frameworks, connects to your tools, and gets maintained by expert coaches. You're not teaching an AI from scratch every conversation—you're picking up where you left off with a strategic partner that already understands."
      },
      {
        question: "Is this for me or my team?",
        answer: "Kowalah Reserved is single-player by design. It's your private space to think, plan, and work through decisions before they're ready to share. While it can access shared documents and business systems your team uses, the conversations and strategic thinking happen between you and your AI Executive Coach alone. No team members see your chats or half-formed ideas."
      },
      {
        question: "How can I structure my workspace?",
        answer: "However your business makes sense to you. Organize by department, region, business unit, time period, strategic initiative—or any combination. The workspace mirrors how you actually see your organization. Some executives structure around their direct reports, others around key projects or planning cycles. During mirroring, we help you design a structure that matches your mental model of the business."
      },
      {
        question: "Is my data safe?",
        answer: "Yes. All workspace files remain on your local machine. The application communicates with Claude's API for AI responses, but your documents never leave your computer. Business tool connectors use secure MCP-based authentication with credentials stored in your system keychain."
      },
      {
        question: "Who are my Kowalah Crew?",
        answer: "Think of it like chartering a yacht or private jet—the vessel alone isn't much use without the crew. Your Kowalah Crew includes senior strategic advisors who speak your language and understand executive priorities, supported by a technical team that works with your IT department to safely configure connections and build custom skills. They handle the setup discreetly, maintain your workspace over time, and ensure you're getting the most from the platform."
      },
      {
        question: "How does pricing work?",
        answer: "Kowalah Reserved isn't a fixed license or a simple subscription—it's a customized package built around how you'll use it. Pricing depends on several factors: the depth of the mirroring process, the number of enterprise connectors you need, how many strategic check-ins with your Kowalah Crew are included, and the complexity of custom skills we build for your workflows. After our initial conversation, we'll scope a package tailored to your specific situation and provide transparent pricing before you commit."
      },
      {
        question: "What is a skill?",
        answer: "A skill is a documented way of doing something—the process, supporting documents, integrations, and templates bundled together. It allows your Kowalah Reserved workspace to carry out work the same way you, your EA, or your chief of staff would: creating documents, updating systems, making arrangements. Skills can be as simple as 'draft my weekly update' or as complex as 'prepare board materials from this quarter's data.'"
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use voice instead of typing?",
        answer: "Absolutely—and we strongly recommend it. We suggest using Wispr Flow, a voice-to-text tool that lets you speak naturally into any application. Many executives find that talking through problems is faster and more natural than typing. Wispr Flow works system-wide, so you can dictate directly into your Kowalah Reserved workspace, emails, documents, or anywhere else. It dramatically accelerates how quickly you can work with your AI Executive Coach."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to be technical?",
        answer: "No. The mirroring process is a series of conversations, not technical configuration. The interface is natural language. If you can send an email, you can use Kowalah Reserved."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the time commitment?",
        answer: "The three-month mirroring process requires roughly 4-6 hours of your time per month—conversations about how you think and work. The Kowalah team handles everything else: building skills, configuring agents, connecting systems."
      },
      {
        question: "When does it start being useful?",
        answer: "Immediately. You can start having strategic conversations from day one. The value compounds over time as the mirror becomes more accurate—by month three, it's like talking to someone who's worked alongside you for years."
      }
    ]
