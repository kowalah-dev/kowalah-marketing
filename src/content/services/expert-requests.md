## The Delivery Mechanism That Prevents the Enthusiasm Gap

Every AI program hits the same wall. Training creates excitement. People have ideas. But without a fast, reliable way to turn those ideas into working solutions, enthusiasm dies. The employee who spotted a workflow that AI could transform submits a request to IT. It joins a backlog. Weeks pass. The moment is gone. They stop suggesting improvements. Multiply this across hundreds of employees, and your AI program stalls.

Expert Requests break this pattern. Your teams submit ideas through the Kowalah platform, and our AI specialists, prompt engineers, developers, and trainers deliver working solutions in 7-14 days. The Sprint identified the highest-value use cases. Training built the skills and excitement. Expert Requests keep that momentum compounding.

### How Expert Requests Fit the Program

The Kowalah approach works because each piece connects to the next:

**AI Impact Sprint** delivers 2-3 working solutions tied to strategic goals, plus a backlog of additional ideas discovered during the engagement.

**Training & Change Enablement** spreads capability across the organization, generating more ideas as people see what's possible.

**Expert Requests** turn all those ideas into production solutions, continuously. Custom GPTs, Claude skills, AI agents, prompt workflows, training sessions, whatever the use case needs.

This is the compounding value model. The Sprint proves value. Training spreads capability. Expert Requests keep new solutions flowing. Each cycle generates more ideas than the last.

### What Gets Delivered

Each Expert Request is a discrete deliverable (typically 4-8 hours of specialist time):

**Custom GPTs & Claude Skills** — AI assistants built for your specific business processes, from department workflows to customer-facing tools.

**Prompt Libraries & Workflows** — Professionally engineered prompts and multi-step workflows for complex business tasks.

**AI Agents & Integrations** — Connections between AI and your business systems (CRM, ERP, data sources) that automate real workflows.

**Training & Support** — Targeted workshops, office hours, new feature sessions, and executive briefings that keep skills growing.

### Platform Visibility

Every Expert Request is tracked through the Kowalah platform alongside your projects and initiatives. Your team can see what's been requested, what's in progress, and what's been delivered. Leadership gets a real-time view of how the AI program is growing across the organization.

### The Expert Requests Advantage

**Immediate access:** Pre-contracted capacity means no SOWs, no procurement delays, no vendor onboarding. When your team has an idea, we can start building within 36 hours.

**Professional quality:** Solutions built by specialists with deep expertise across Claude, ChatGPT, and enterprise AI environments.

**Predictable delivery:** 7-14 day delivery windows with 36-hour response guarantee keep your AI program moving.

**Connected to your program:** Every Expert Request aligns with your broader AI strategy and builds on your Sprint results and training outcomes.
