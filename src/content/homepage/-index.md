  title: "The Enthusiasm Gap"
  subtitle: "Training creates excitement, but not execution. That's why most AI initiatives fail."
  before:
    organizational:
      - "AI training programs completed—but nothing changed"
      - "Teams excited about possibilities—but struggling to implement"
      - "Generic training that doesn't connect to actual business workflows"
      - "Ideas stuck in IT backlog where enthusiasm dies"
      - "No clear pathway from 'I learned about AI' to 'AI is delivering value'"
      - "Millions spent on licenses and training with little to show for it"
    individual:
      - "Completed AI training but still using it only for basic tasks"
      - "Know AI could help but don't know where to start on real work"
      - "Frustrated gap between 'what I learned' and 'what I can do'"
      - "Ideas for AI applications but no time or support to build them"
      - "Using personal ChatGPT because corporate tools don't deliver"
      - "Feeling like they're falling behind despite training investment"
  after:
    organizational:
      - "Real AI solutions delivering measurable business impact from week one"
      - "Internal champions who've experienced what's possible and can lead others"
      - "Training powered by internal examples—'Here's what Sarah in Finance built'"
      - "Ideas get built through Expert Requests—no IT backlog, no dying enthusiasm"
      - "Continuous pipeline of new AI capabilities spreading across departments"
      - "Compounding value from AI that grows month over month"
    individual:
      - "Working AI solutions for actual daily challenges—built with expert help"
      - "Clear examples from colleagues that make possibilities concrete and achievable"
      - "Ongoing access to experts who turn ideas into working tools"
      - "AI integrated into real workflows, not just theoretical understanding"
      - "Confidence from seeing real results, not just learning concepts"
      - "Part of an innovation pipeline that keeps delivering new capabilities"

    from: "We trained everyone on AI—now we hope they figure it out"
    to: "We build wins first, then train with real examples from our own teams"

      why_matters: "Most AI initiatives follow a logical-seeming sequence: train everyone, then hope they find use cases. But this creates the Enthusiasm Gap.<br><br>People leave training excited about possibilities but uncertain how to apply them. Without immediate proof points, that enthusiasm fades. Ideas get stuck in backlogs. The training investment doesn't translate to business value.<br><br>We've seen this pattern repeatedly—and we've developed a better approach."
