    individual:
      - "Employees curious about AI but unsure how it applies to their specific work"
      - "Basic prompt skills limiting the value people get from AI interactions"
      - "No exposure to advanced capabilities like custom GPTs, voice, and workflows"
      - "Inconsistent AI skill levels across teams making collaboration harder"
  after:
    organizational:
      - "AI solutions tied to strategic metrics with board-ready proof points"
      - "AI Ambassadors network (10% of workforce) driving adoption and sharing wins"
