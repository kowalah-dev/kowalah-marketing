about:
  title: "From AI Chaos to Enterprise Excellence"
  content: "Companies reach out to us after board meetings and peer conversations when they realize they need an AI plan, fast. Their IT teams may be evaluating platforms and building proofs of concept, but executives know their people, and they themselves, are already using AI tools to get real work done without any structure or governance. <br><br>We bridge this gap. We sit next to your people, in finance, HR, sales, marketing, and show them exactly how to use AI for their specific work. Not theory. Not videos. Hands-on enablement that turns every employee into a confident AI practitioner. <br><br>That's what sets us apart: we focus on the person at the desk, what's on their screen, and how they actually work. We deploy across [Claude](/platforms/anthropic), [ChatGPT](/platforms/openai), and multi-platform environments, always matching the right tool to your organization's needs."

story:
  title: "Our Story: Why We Focus on People, Not Technology"
  subtitle: "Founded by Charlie Cowan"
  content: "After 25 years in enterprise SaaS sales and consulting, Charlie went independent three years ago. What he discovered was startling: the gap between what AI could do and what companies were actually doing with it was massive, and growing daily. <br><br>From leading global Google Workspace rollouts into companies with up to 100,000 employees, Charlie learned a fundamental truth: if you just give people Google Drive, they'll still email attachments. You have to show them collaboration. <br><br>Kowalah's unfair advantage? We think about the person in HR, the person in finance, the person in sales, what's on their screen and how they work, not about building custom models or fine-tuning. Companies don't need an AI strategy document. They need every employee to figure out a new way to work. <br><br>Kowalah uses the electricity analogy: it doesn't matter how electricity gets to your wall, wind turbines, transformers, AC/DC, that's all on the other side. What matters is what you plug in: your computer, your fridge, your tools. That's our focus with AI: opening every person's eyes to the tools they've got available and showing them how to use those tools in their everyday work."

  quote: "If you don't show people how to use AI, they'll carry on using it the same way they use Google: asking questions and expecting answers. That only scratches the surface of what these tools are capable of."

faq:
  title: "Partnering with Kowalah"
  subtitle: "Common Questions About Our Company"
  faqs:
    - question: "Which AI platforms do you work with?"
      answer: "We work with the platforms that deliver the best results for your organization. Our deep expertise spans [Claude](/platforms/anthropic) and [ChatGPT](/platforms/openai), and we help you choose the right platform, or multi-platform strategy, based on your specific needs. We focus on what employees actually use and need rather than any single vendor's roadmap."

    - question: "What makes Kowalah different from AI consultancies?"
      answer: "Traditional consultancies deliver reports and recommendations, then leave. We're an AI-enabled services business, combining expert human delivery with platform technology for ongoing partnership. You get immediate Expert Request delivery (custom prompts, assistants, training) alongside strategic guidance. We don't just tell you what to do; we build the solutions and stay with you as your permanent AI extension team."

    - question: "Is Kowalah a product business or a services business?"
      answer: "We're both, a services-plus-platform business. While our implementation programs deliver hands-on training and change enablement, the Kowalah platform becomes your ongoing connection to continuous value. After your initial deployment, the platform gives you access to our services, our AI accelerators, Expert Requests for custom assistants and prompts, and the collective intelligence from every Kowalah customer implementation. You're not buying software or consulting hours, you're gaining a permanent AI capability partner."

    - question: "How long has Kowalah been in business?"
      answer: "Kowalah was founded in 2023 to solve a problem our founder Charlie experienced firsthand: leading AI transformation at companies with up to 100,000 employees and seeing the massive gap between executive AI ambition and practical employee adoption. We've channeled 25+ years of enterprise technology experience into defining what AI-enabled services means, platform technology plus expert human delivery for enterprise AI rollouts."

    - question: "Do you work with companies outside the UK and US?"
      answer: "Yes. While our primary markets are UK and US, we serve clients globally. Our platform delivery model and Expert Request system work seamlessly across time zones. Our mission is to become the world's leading partner for enterprise AI deployment, and we're building global capabilities to support that vision."

    - question: "What's your approach to AI governance and security?"
      answer: "We help you implement proper enterprise AI governance while giving employees the tools they prefer. This includes working with IT, InfoSec, and Legal teams to evaluate platform security credentials, establish usage policies, eliminate shadow AI, and create visibility into organizational AI adoption. We turn uncontrolled personal AI usage into strategic capability with full governance."

    - question: "How deep is Kowalah's AI platform expertise?"
      answer: "We specialize in advanced AI capabilities most companies don't know exist: voice-enabled coaching sessions, custom assistants for department workflows, collaborative workspaces for complex work, and document collaboration tools. Our team stays current with every platform release across Claude, ChatGPT, and more, ensuring your people leverage new features immediately, not months later after reading release notes."

    - question: "How do you stay ahead of the rapidly changing AI landscape?"
      answer: "Our focus is client outcomes, not technology loyalty. We maintain deep expertise across leading AI platforms and continuously evaluate new capabilities as they emerge. When a platform adds features that benefit your workflows, we help you adopt them immediately. This multi-platform approach means your organization always has access to the best available tools."
