  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  subtitle: "Everything you need to know about running successful prompt hackathons"
  questions:
    - question: "Do I need to be an AI expert to facilitate this workshop?"
      answer: "No! This guide is specifically designed for business professionals with no technical or AI expertise. The ideal facilitator understands business processes, can guide group discussions, and can follow structured timing. The guide provides everything you need including scripts, talking points, and examples. If you can facilitate a workshop and understand how work gets done in your organization, you can run this hackathon."
    - question: "How many participants should I include in each hackathon?"
      answer: "Keep groups to 10-15 participants maximum. This ensures everyone gets individual attention and active participation. Importantly, focus each hackathon on a single team or function (e.g., just Finance, just HR, just Marketing). This ensures every use case developed is relevant to every attendee, creating better collaboration and engagement than mixed-function groups."
    - question: "What AI platforms can participants use during the hackathon?"
      answer: "The guide covers three main options: (1) API access via Claude Workbench or OpenAI Playground - most flexible for testing and future integration; (2) Corporate Team/Enterprise accounts for Claude, ChatGPT, or other platforms - best for ongoing usage and governance; (3) Individual paid accounts - quickest to set up for pilots. Your choice depends on your organization's AI strategy, timeline, budget, and whether you want participants to continue using their prompts post-hackathon."
    - question: "What should participants prepare before the hackathon?"
      answer: "Send participants a pre-work survey 1 week before asking them to identify: (1) Top 3 processes they regularly manage; (2) Key policies that guide their work; (3) Templates/documents they frequently use. This gets them thinking about their workflows so they arrive ready to focus on a high-impact use case. The guide includes a complete pre-work survey template."
    - question: "What outcomes can I expect from a 2-hour hackathon?"
      answer: "Each participant will develop at least one production-ready AI prompt addressing a real business need in their daily work. Success metrics include: 100% of attendees using their developed prompt within the first week, 50% sharing their prompt with team members, and 30% developing additional prompts within the first month. Participants gain practical prompt engineering skills, hands-on AI experience, and templates for ongoing development."
    - question: "How much does it cost to run a prompt hackathon?"
      answer: "Primary costs are AI platform access (ranging from $20/month per user for individual accounts to enterprise pricing for corporate solutions) and facilitator time. Room costs and materials are minimal (post-its, markers, standard meeting room). The guide helps you evaluate platform options based on your budget, with implementation tips for each approach. Most organizations find the productivity gains from improved processes quickly offset the modest investment."
    - question: "Can I run this hackathon virtually or does it need to be in-person?"
      answer: "While in-person is preferred for energy and collaboration, the hackathon can run virtually. The guide includes adaptation notes for virtual delivery. Key virtual considerations: ensure all participants test AI platform access beforehand, use breakout rooms for pair discussions, allow extra time for technology setup, and leverage collaborative tools like Google Docs or Miro for sharing prompts and feedback."
    - question: "How do I track success and measure ROI after the hackathon?"
      answer: "The guide includes comprehensive post-hackathon tracking tools covering: (1) Participation metrics (attendance, pre-work completion, active engagement); (2) Output metrics (prompts developed, tested, and addressing real needs); (3) Implementation metrics (usage rates, prompt sharing, additional prompt development); (4) Long-term impact (time saved per process, error reduction, team satisfaction, adoption rates). Track these across Week 1, Weeks 2-4, and Month 2+ for complete visibility."
    - question: "What happens after the first hackathon? How do I scale this across my organization?"
      answer: "The guide includes a scaling framework for organization-wide rollout. After your first successful hackathon: (1) Collect and share success stories to build momentum; (2) Create a prompt library for teams to share learnings; (3) Run additional hackathons with other teams/functions; (4) Develop internal champions who can facilitate future sessions; (5) Establish regular 'prompt sharing' sessions for ongoing learning. Many organizations start with one team, refine their approach, then scale to monthly hackathons across departments."
    - question: "What if participants get stuck or can't think of a good use case during the workshop?"
      answer: "The guide includes facilitation tips for common challenges. If someone struggles with use case selection, have them talk through a 'day-in-the-life' to identify repetitive tasks. The pre-work survey should give them ideas to start with. If prompts become too broad or complex, bring participants back to a single simple task they do today. If participants get too ambitious, refocus them on improving an existing workflow rather than creating something entirely new. The key is starting with something they already do regularly."

# Implementation Notes

## Getting Started

1. **Read through the entire guide** before your first facilitation to understand the flow
2. **Run at least one dry run** if this is your first time facilitating - practice your talk track out loud (you speak faster in your head than out loud!)
3. **Start with a single team** rather than mixed functions for better relevance and engagement
4. **Choose high-impact processes** that participants use frequently (daily/weekly) rather than annual edge cases
5. **Test technology access** at least 1 week before to resolve any authentication or platform issues

## Customization Tips

Adapt the guide for your organization's context by:

- **Adding company-specific examples** of processes, policies, or templates relevant to participants
- **Adjusting timing** if you need longer/shorter sessions (though 2 hours works well for maintaining energy)
- **Tailoring platform recommendations** to match your company's AI strategy and existing investments
- **Incorporating your brand** in invitation templates and communication materials
- **Aligning success metrics** with your organization's AI adoption goals and KPIs

## Success Factors

Successful hackathons share these characteristics:

- **Focused audience** - Single team or function creates better collaboration
- **Prepared participants** - Pre-work survey completion rate >90%
- **Real-world focus** - Participants work on actual processes they use today
- **Safe environment** - Non-judgmental space for experimentation and learning
- **Post-hackathon support** - Week 1 check-ins and prompt library for sharing
- **Visible champions** - Leadership acknowledgment of participants' new capabilities

## Scaling Considerations

As you expand beyond your first hackathon:

- **Develop internal facilitators** from successful participants who can run future sessions
- **Create a centralized prompt library** where teams share successful prompts across functions
- **Establish regular cadence** (e.g., monthly hackathons) for sustained capability building
- **Track organizational metrics** to demonstrate ROI and justify continued investment
- **Connect to broader AI strategy** ensuring workshops support overall transformation goals
