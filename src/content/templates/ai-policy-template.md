  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  subtitle: "Common questions about AI policies and responsible AI adoption"
  questions:
    - question: "Do I need an AI policy before deploying ChatGPT Enterprise?"
      answer: "While not legally required, we strongly recommend implementing an AI policy before rolling out ChatGPT Enterprise. A clear policy establishes guidelines for acceptable use, protects sensitive data, ensures compliance with regulations, reduces organizational risk, and builds employee confidence in using AI tools responsibly."
    - question: "How is this template different from traditional IT policies?"
      answer: "This template takes an 'AI-positive' approach, focusing on enabling and encouraging AI adoption rather than restricting use. It emphasizes what employees should do with AI, provides practical examples by department, and frames guidelines as enabling safe innovation rather than creating barriers."
    - question: "Should our AI policy be permissive or restrictive?"
      answer: "We recommend a permissive, trust-based approach that encourages exploration while providing clear guardrails for data protection. Overly restrictive policies drive AI usage to unmanaged shadow IT, while clear, enabling guidelines help employees use AI confidently and responsibly within your governance framework."
    - question: "How often should we update our AI policy?"
      answer: "Review your AI policy quarterly at minimum. The AI landscape evolves rapidly with new capabilities, tools, and use cases emerging frequently. Regular updates ensure your policy remains relevant, incorporates lessons learned, and adapts to new AI developments."
    - question: "What's the difference between ChatGPT Free and ChatGPT Enterprise regarding data privacy?"
      answer: "ChatGPT Free uses conversations to train models and improve the service. ChatGPT Enterprise (and Team) provides enterprise-grade security with zero data training - your conversations and data are never used to train models. This policy template emphasizes using approved enterprise tools for any work involving company or customer data."
    - question: "How do we handle employees who want to use AI tools not on our approved list?"
      answer: "Create a streamlined approval process with a default-to-yes approach. Require a brief tool assessment form, commit to reviewing within 2 business days, and approve unless specific risks are identified. This keeps AI usage visible and manageable while enabling innovation."
    - question: "Should we monitor AI usage by employees?"
      answer: "Focus monitoring on identifying successful patterns to share, understanding tool effectiveness, and ensuring appropriate data handling - not on policing usage. Position monitoring as learning-focused rather than enforcement-focused to encourage open discussion about AI experiments and use cases."

# Purpose and Scope

## Purpose Overview

*This section describes why we have an AI policy and what it aims to achieve. As an AI-positive organisation we want to emphasise that this policy aims to enable and encourage AI adoption while providing clear guidelines for responsible use.*

**Example text:** "[Company name] recognises AI as a transformative technology that can enhance our productivity, creativity and competitive advantage. This policy provides guidelines to help you use AI effectively while protecting our interests. We've kept the policy short, but to summarise in one sentence - we will use AI to win"

## Scope Definition

*Here we'll define what this policy covers. Include all employees, contractors and potentially partners that interact with company data. Also specify which types of AI tools are covered.*

**Example text:** "This policy applies to all employees, contractors and partners that use AI tools for company-related work, including but not limited to large language models, image generation tools and code assistants. It applies to AI tools and models available at the time of publishing this policy, and any new AI products that may be released in the future"

# Our AI Philosophy

*This section sets the tone for the entire policy. For AI-positive companies, make a clear statement about embracing AI as a core enabler of business success.*

**Example text:** "We view AI as a powerful tool for complementing human capabilities, not replacing them. We encourage exploration and experimentation with AI tools, believing that early adoption and learning will give us competitive advantage. We seek to become an AI-enabled organisation and will empower and reward employees that build AI capabilities into their work.

# Encouraged Uses

*Many AI policies focus on what you can't do with AI. Instead, AI-positive companies should highlight specific ways employees are encouraged to use AI, organised by department or function. Make it clear this list is not exhaustive but illustrative.*

**Example text for different functions:**

| **Marketing** <br>• Draft and refine marketing copy<br>• Generate and iterate on creative concepts<br>• Educating prospects and customers<br>• Analyse market trends and customer feedback | **Sales** <br>• Research target accounts<br>• Personalise sales outreach<br>• Negotiation strategy planning<br>• Role playing customer calls |
| :---- | :---- |
| **R&D** <br>• Experiment design and optimisation<br>• Hypothesis generation and testing<br>• Data analysis and visualisation | **Engineering** <br>• Code assistance and review<br>• Documentation generation<br>• Product mock ups and user feedback<br>• Problem solving and de-bugging |
| **Legal** <br>• Contract review and analysis<br>• Due diligence support<br>• Regulatory requirement analysis | **Finance** <br>• Audit support and documentation<br>• Month end closing processes<br>• Data analysis and reconciliation<br>• M&A support |

# Data and IP Protection Guidelines

*Frame these guidelines as enabling safe innovation rather than restrictive rules. Focus on practical approaches that protect both operational data and intellectual property while maintaining usability.*

*Remind employees which tools you provide that have appropriate protections in place (such a Team/Enterprise accounts for Claude or ChatGPT)*

**Example text:** "When using AI tools, follow these practical guidelines to protect our information:

## For Company Data

1. Use approved enterprise AI tools for sensitive data. A full list is included at the end of this document, but specifically use our company [Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini] account rather than a personal account.
2. Verify AI outputs before sharing externally - imagine it was provided to you by a junior intern - check, verify, edit before you pass it on as your own work.
3. Break down complex tasks to minimize sharing of sensitive information - for example, if you want AI to build you a Python script to merge two customer data csvs, only pass the column headings rather than the full csvs.
4. Use generic examples when seeking AI assistance with confidential matters

## For Intellectual Property

1. Don't share source code without removing basic business logic
2. Use placeholder data when discussing proprietary processes
3. Be generic when describing our unique business methods
4. Document significant AI contributions to inventions
5. Consider locally hosted AI tools for sensitive work
6. **If you aren't sure - ask!** Get an immediate response in our [Slack|Teams #canidothis channel] or "Can I chat it?" GPT

And for all sensitive information - report any accidental data exposure immediately - **let us help you assess and resolve the situation."**

# Tool Selection and Approval

*Create a streamlined process that enables quick adoption of newly released tools and models while maintaining oversight. Focus on enabling rather than controlling - it is always better that your people use tools within your visibility that outside of it.*

**Example text:** "We maintain a list of pre-approved AI tools for common use cases. If you find a new tool that you'd like to try that is not on the list:

1. Submit a brief tool assessment form
2. IT will review and respond within 2 business days
3. Default is to approve unless specific risks are identified"

# Best Practices

*Provide practical guidance that helps employees to use AI effectively. You will have a broader change enablement program so this is just to highlight the importance of sharing best practices.*

**Example text:** "To get the best results from AI:

1. Be specific in your prompts
2. Verify factual outputs (especially when relating to customer data)
3. Learn from what works
4. Use [ChatGPT Projects/Claude Projects/Gemini Gems] to provide context
5. Share successful approaches with colleagues
6. Start with small tasks and expand across your team's processes
7. Document effective prompts for reuse"

# Training and Support

*Use this section to highlight the company's commitment to helping all employees to succeed with AI.*

**Example text:** "We provide:

1. Regular in person and virtual AI skills training
2. An AI Ambassadors network in each team
3. AI Business Partners aligned to each department
4. Weekly Office Hours for AI-related questions
5. Internal video/document library of best practices
6. Weekly Lunch and Learn sessions in each of our buildings"

# Compliance and Monitoring

*Keep this brief or it risks putting your teams off discussing their AI usage openly. Focus on enabling safe usage rather than enforcement.*

**Example text:** "We trust our employees to use AI responsibly. Our monitoring focuses on:

1. Identifying successful use patterns to share
2. Understanding tool effectiveness in our company's context
3. Ensuring appropriate handling of sensitive data
4. Supporting teams in using AI effectively

In short, you will be thanked and recognised for using AI - just be sensible and if you aren't sure - ask"

# Review and Updates

*Highlight that the world of AI is moving fast and that this policy has to adapt as new tools and models are released.*

**Example text:** "This policy will be reviewed at least quarterly to:

1. Include new AI capabilities
2. Add successful use cases
3. Update best practices
4. Remove any outdated restrictions
5. Incorporate team feedback

This AI policy is also provided as a [ChatGPT GPT/Claude Project] so if you have any questions about the current policy - ask there for the latest guidance."

# Getting Help

*Make it clear and easy for employees to get support. We want this policy to encourage your people to talk about their ideas, their experiments and to get advice.*

**Example text:** "For any AI-related questions or support:

1. Contact your department's AI Business Partner
2. Speak with your team's AI Ambassador
3. Visit the AI resource centre on the Intranet
4. Join the #ai-help [Slack|Teams channel]
5. Attend the next AI Office Hours
6. Email ai-help@company.com"

# Appendix

1. ChatGPT Business/Enterprise
2. Claude Enterprise
3. etc

# Implementation Notes

When implementing this template:

1. Customise the tone and content to match your company culture - we have written this as an encouraging AI-positive policy - if that is not your approach you'll want to change many of the examples.
2. Add specific examples for your industry and company - especially in the encouraged use cases section.
3. Update the approved tools section to those you have actually approved
4. Consider creating a one pager or infographic for quick reference
5. Create a custom GPT or Claude Project with this policy as knowledge for your employees to discuss with
6. Link out to any training, list of AI Ambassadors and AI Business Partners and the Office Hours schedule

Remember this is a starting point - you should adapt it based on your:

1. Company size and structure
2. Geographic location and regulations
3. Industry requirements
4. Regulatory environment
5. Current AI maturity
6. Risk tolerance
7. Employee technical literacy
