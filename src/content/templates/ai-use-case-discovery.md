  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  subtitle: "Common questions about conducting AI use case discovery interviews"
  questions:
    - question: "How many people should I interview to get meaningful results?"
      answer: "Start with 5-10 people per functional area to identify patterns. You'll typically see repeated pain points and use cases emerge after 3-4 interviews within the same function. For organization-wide discovery, aim for at least 2-3 representatives from each major department (Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations, HR, etc.). Quality matters more than quantity - thorough interviews with engaged employees yield better insights than rushed conversations with many people."
    - question: "Should I interview senior leaders or individual contributors first?"
      answer: "Start with individual contributors and mid-level managers who do the actual work daily. They have the most detailed knowledge of repetitive tasks, time-wasters, and workflow friction points. Senior leaders often have strategic perspectives but may be disconnected from day-to-day operational pain points. Interview executives later to validate findings and identify strategic-level AI applications. The best use cases typically come from people closest to the work."
    - question: "How do I position these interviews so employees don't worry about being replaced by AI?"
      answer: "Frame the conversation as an opportunity to eliminate tedious work and enhance their role, not replace it. Open with: 'This is not an evaluation - we want to understand your daily challenges and explore how AI could make your job more enjoyable and strategic.' Emphasize that AI should handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks so they can focus on higher-value work that requires human judgment, creativity, and relationship skills. Invite participants to your AI Ambassador program to make them partners in the transformation, not subjects of it."
    - question: "What if employees say 'I don't know how AI could help with my work'?"
      answer: "That's completely normal - most employees aren't AI experts. That's why this template focuses on discovering their tasks and pain points, not asking them to identify AI solutions. Your job is to ask: 'What takes the most time?', 'What do you put off?', 'What's repetitive?' The AI application ideas come later when you analyze the patterns. Sometimes the best discoveries come from people who say 'I don't think AI applies to my role' - they often describe highly repetitive processes they've stopped noticing."
    - question: "How long should each interview take?"
      answer: "Plan for 30-45 minutes per interview. Daily tasks take 10-15 minutes to explore thoroughly, weekly and monthly tasks another 10-15 minutes, and pain points plus wrap-up take the final 10-15 minutes. If you're short on time, focus deeply on daily tasks (where the highest-frequency opportunities exist) and pain points. Don't rush - a thoughtful 30-minute conversation reveals more than a hurried 15-minute checklist."
    - question: "Should I share examples of AI use cases before or during the interview?"
      answer: "Wait until after you've asked about their tasks and pain points. If you share examples first, you'll anchor their thinking and may miss unique opportunities specific to their workflow. Let them describe their work in their own terms first. After exploring their tasks, you can share relevant examples: 'Other teams have used AI for [similar task] - does that resonate with your workflow?' This approach uncovers both expected and surprising use cases."
    - question: "What should I do with the interview findings?"
      answer: "Create a centralized database or spreadsheet tracking: function, role, task frequency, pain point severity, and estimated time savings. Look for patterns across interviews - use cases mentioned by multiple people in different teams are high-priority candidates. Cluster similar use cases (e.g., all content generation, all data analysis, all scheduling/coordination) to identify horizontal AI solutions that benefit multiple teams. Prioritize based on frequency × impact × ease of implementation. Share aggregated findings back to participants to build engagement and validate priorities."
    - question: "How do I identify which use cases to prioritize for implementation?"
      answer: "Use a simple scoring framework: Frequency (daily=3, weekly=2, monthly=1) × Impact (hours saved or quality improvement) × Ease (1-5 scale, with 5=very easy). High-frequency, high-impact, easy-to-implement use cases are your quick wins. Also consider: (1) Use cases mentioned by multiple people across different teams, (2) Tasks people actively avoid or complain about, (3) Work that happens outside normal hours because there's no time during the day. Quick wins build momentum for more complex use cases later."
    - question: "Can this template be used for remote/async interviews?"
      answer: "Yes, but synchronous conversations (video call or in-person) work best for discovery interviews. Real-time dialogue lets you ask follow-up questions, notice patterns, and explore unexpected insights that emerge. If async is necessary, turn the template into a structured questionnaire and follow up with brief video calls to clarify interesting responses. Alternatively, use the template as an async 'homework' exercise before a shorter synchronous discussion - employees prepare their task lists in advance, then you explore pain points and opportunities in real-time."
    - question: "Should I record these interviews or just take notes?"
      answer: "Recording (with permission) is valuable but not essential. If you record, clearly explain it's only for your reference to ensure accuracy - not for evaluation or sharing widely. Many people are more candid without recording. Strong note-taking works well: use the template as your notes structure, capture specific task descriptions verbatim (especially when they describe pain points), and mark high-priority items with asterisks or highlights. Immediately after each interview, spend 5 minutes summarizing key insights while they're fresh - this synthesis is more valuable than transcripts."

- What systems, tools, or software do you use for these daily tasks?

**Time and Energy Analysis:**
- What wastes most of your time during the day?
- What tasks do you tend to put off or procrastinate on?
- What would you eliminate if you could?

**Capture:** List specific daily tasks, tools used, collaboration patterns, and time-wasters.

---

## Weekly Schedule

**Objective:** Identify recurring weekly tasks that consume significant time or mental energy.

### Discovery Questions

**Are there specific tasks you complete on a weekly basis?**
- Examples: Timesheets, weekly summaries, 1:1 meetings, progress reports, team updates, data compilation, status reports
- How are these weekly tasks different from your daily work?
- What wastes most of your time on these weekly activities?

**Capture:** Weekly recurring tasks, their purpose, time investment, and friction points.

---

## Monthly or Quarterly Schedule

**Objective:** Uncover periodic high-value tasks where AI could provide significant leverage.

### Discovery Questions

**Are there tasks you complete monthly or quarterly?**
- Examples: Closing the books, payroll processing, expense reports, forecasting, management reports, board presentations, tax preparation, compliance reviews, quarterly business reviews
- How do these differ from your weekly and daily work?
- What takes the most time in these periodic activities?
- What causes the most stress or requires the most manual effort?

**Capture:** Periodic tasks, complexity levels, manual effort required, and high-stress components.

---

## One-Off and Irregular Tasks

**Objective:** Identify ad-hoc work that creates interruptions and eats productive time.

### Discovery Questions

**What irregular tasks take up significant time?**
- Examples: Answering repetitive questions from colleagues, writing new policies, onboarding new team members, updating other departments, finding the latest version of documents, special projects, crisis management
- What makes these tasks particularly time-consuming?
- How often do these irregular tasks interrupt your planned work?

**Capture:** Common ad-hoc requests, information-seeking patterns, knowledge transfer activities.

---

## Pain Points and Improvement Suggestions

**Objective:** Understand what frustrates employees most and what they wish was easier.

### Discovery Questions

**What are the biggest challenges you face in completing your work?**
- What tasks prevent you from doing higher-value work?
- If you're doing [repetitive task X], what are you *not* doing instead?
- What would be most helpful in improving these tasks?
- If you had a magic wand to eliminate or automate one thing, what would it be?

**Priority Assessment:**
- Which pain points affect you daily vs. occasionally?
- Which have the biggest impact on your ability to do strategic work?
- Which create the most frustration or stress?

**Capture:** Top 3-5 pain points, their frequency, and the opportunity cost (what they're not doing because of these tasks).

---

## Wrap Up and Next Steps

**Summarize What You Heard:**
- Reflect back the key tasks, patterns, and pain points you identified
- Validate your understanding: "Did I capture that correctly?"
- Ask if there's anything important they didn't get to mention

# Implementation Notes

When using this template for AI use case discovery:

## Before Interviews

1. **Select a diverse interview pool**: Include different functions, seniority levels, and work styles. Don't only interview "tech-savvy" employees - often the best insights come from people doing highly repetitive manual work.

2. **Schedule appropriately**: 30-45 minutes is ideal. Book meetings as "AI opportunity discovery" or "workflow improvement discussion" - avoid calling it an "AI interview" which may intimidate some participants.

3. **Prepare your mindset**: You're not looking for people who already know AI solutions. You're looking for patterns of repetitive work, manual data handling, content creation, scheduling, analysis, or communication tasks that consume time.

## During Interviews

1. **Lead with curiosity, not solutions**: Don't suggest AI applications too early. First understand their actual workflow, then identify opportunities afterward.

2. **Ask "why" and "how" questions**: When they mention a task, dig deeper: "How long does that typically take?" "Why is that difficult?" "How often does this happen?"

3. **Listen for specific language**: Pay attention when people say:
   - "I spend hours on..."
   - "This is so repetitive..."
   - "I wish I could just..."
   - "I have to manually..."
   - "I'm always searching for..."

4. **Don't promise solutions**: Say "That's really helpful context" instead of "AI can definitely solve that." Set expectations that you're gathering insights, not committing to specific implementations.

## After Interviews

1. **Consolidate findings quickly**: Within 24 hours, capture key insights while the conversation is fresh. Use a simple spreadsheet with columns: Function | Role | Daily Tasks | Weekly Tasks | Monthly Tasks | Top Pain Points | AI Opportunity Areas | Priority.

2. **Look for patterns across roles**: The same use case appearing across multiple departments (e.g., "summarizing meeting notes") signals high-value, horizontal AI opportunities.

3. **Categorize by AI capability type**:
   - **Content generation**: Writing, emails, reports, documentation
   - **Data analysis**: Extracting insights, creating summaries, identifying patterns
   - **Research & information retrieval**: Finding documents, answering questions, gathering data
   - **Administrative coordination**: Scheduling, reminders, status updates
   - **Repetitive processing**: Data entry, formatting, quality checks

4. **Prioritize with a simple framework**:
   - **Quick wins**: High frequency + Low complexity (daily tasks that are straightforward to automate)
   - **High impact**: Significant time savings or quality improvement (even if more complex)
   - **Strategic**: Unlocks higher-value work or supports business priorities

5. **Share back with participants**: Close the loop by sending aggregated findings (anonymized) and next steps. This builds engagement and validates that their input mattered.

## Adaptation Tips

Customize this template based on your:

1. **Organization size**: Smaller organizations (< 100 people) can interview more comprehensively. Larger organizations should focus on representative samples per function.

2. **Industry context**: Add industry-specific task examples to the framework. Manufacturing might emphasize quality control and equipment monitoring; professional services might focus on client deliverables and proposal development.

3. **AI maturity level**: For AI beginners, spend more time on the introduction explaining what AI can and can't do. For more advanced organizations, ask about current AI usage and barriers to adoption.

4. **Cultural factors**: Some cultures are more direct about pain points; others require more rapport-building before people share frustrations. Adapt your interview style accordingly.

5. **Remote vs. in-person**: Video interviews work well but lose some spontaneous follow-up opportunities. In-person allows better reading of body language and energy when discussing pain points.

Remember: The goal isn't to become an AI expert - it's to become an expert in your employees' workflows. AI solutions follow naturally from deep workflow understanding.
