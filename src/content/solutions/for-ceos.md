# AI That Delivers Business Impact—For CEOs

You've probably invested in AI already. Licenses, training programs, maybe even consultants. Your teams completed the training, got excited about the possibilities... and then went back to their old ways within a few weeks.

This is the **Enthusiasm Gap**—and it's why most AI initiatives fail to deliver business value despite significant investment.

## The Problem With Training-First AI

The traditional AI approach seems logical: train everyone on AI tools, then let them find use cases. But this creates predictable problems:

- **Excitement Without Execution**: People leave training excited but uncertain how to apply it to real work
- **Ideas Without Implementation**: Great AI ideas get stuck in IT backlogs, competing with "real work"
- **Enthusiasm Dies**: Without quick wins, excitement fades and the training investment is wasted
- **Platform Confusion**: Different teams using different AI tools with no clear strategy

**Your personal AI experience proves there's a better way.** You get value from AI because you've found specific use cases that matter to your work. The challenge is replicating that across your organisation.

## The Kowalah Approach: Build First, Enable Change

We flip the sequence to prevent the Enthusiasm Gap:

### 1. AI Impact Sprint (2-3 Weeks)
We embed with 2-3 of your key stakeholders—getting into the weeds of their actual work. We identify highest-value AI opportunities and build working solutions: prompts, GPTs, workflows—whatever the use case requires.

**Outcome**: Real wins on the board, internal champions who've experienced what's possible, and concrete examples to share.

### 2. Change Enablement
With proof points in hand, we scale AI capability across your organisation. This isn't just training—it's complete change enablement: AI Ambassador networks, governance frameworks, cultural transformation, and yes, training powered by those internal examples that make it real.

**Outcome**: Organisation-wide AI capability with sustainable adoption, not just one-off training that fades.

### 3. Kowalah Essential: Continuous Value
After enablement, people have ideas—and we don't want those ideas to die. Organisation-wide platform access means anyone can submit Expert Requests. Monthly allocation ensures continuous solution building.

**Outcome**: Permanent AI partnership that keeps delivering value, not a project with an end date.

## Platform Expertise

We have deep expertise across the major AI platforms—and we'll tell you what works:

- **ChatGPT**: Best for conversational interfaces, custom GPTs, and voice capabilities
- **Claude**: Excellent for analysis, long-form content, and complex reasoning
- **Gemini**: Strong for Google Workspace integration and multimodal tasks

The right platform depends on what you're trying to achieve. We'll recommend based on your specific use cases—and help you get real value from whatever you choose.

## See Impact Before You Commit

The AI Impact Sprint lets you prove value with key people before any organisation-wide commitment:

- **Low Risk**: £6-40k depending on scope, not six-figure transformation programs
- **Quick Proof**: 2-3 weeks, not 6-month implementations
- **Real Results**: Working solutions delivering business value, not PowerPoints about potential
- **Internal Champions**: Key people who've experienced what's possible and can advocate for scaling

## Ready to See AI That Actually Delivers?

Book an AI Impact Sprint discovery call. We'll discuss your specific challenges, explore where AI could deliver real business value, and explain how we'd prove it—before any organisation-wide commitment.

**This is a strategic discussion about business outcomes**—not a technology pitch about AI platforms.
