Use AI to make your work better and faster\n2. Try new AI tools and share what works\n3. Ask for help if you're unsure\n\nJust remember to:\n\n1. Keep customer and company confidential information private\n2. Double check AI-generated content before sharing externally\n3. Use company AI tools for sensitive work\n4. Share your success stories with colleagues\n\nThat's it! The rest of this document provides more detailed guidance when you need it.\n\n---\n\n# Purpose and Scope\n\n## Purpose Overview\n\n*This section describes why we have an AI policy and what it aims to achieve. As an AI-positive organisation we want to emphasise that this policy aims to enable and encourage AI adoption while providing clear guidelines for responsible use.*\n\n**Example text:** \"[Company name] recognises AI as a transformative technology that can enhance our productivity, creativity and competitive advantage. This policy provides guidelines to help you use AI effectively while protecting our interests. We've kept the policy short, but to summarise in one sentence - we will use AI to win\"\n\n## Scope Definition\n\n*Here we'll define what this policy covers. Include all employees, contractors and potentially partners that interact with company data. Also specify which types of AI tools are covered.*\n\n**Example text:** \"This policy applies to all employees, contractors and partners that use AI tools for company-related work, including but not limited to large language models, image generation tools and code assistants. It applies to AI tools and models available at the time of publishing this policy, and any new AI products that may be released in the future\"\n\n# Our AI Philosophy\n\n*This section sets the tone for the entire policy. For AI-positive companies, make a clear statement about embracing AI as a core enabler of business success.*\n\n**Example text:** \"We view AI as a powerful tool for complementing human capabilities, not replacing them. We encourage exploration and experimentation with AI tools, believing that early adoption and learning will give us competitive advantage. We seek to become an AI-enabled organisation and will empower and reward employees that build AI capabilities into their work.\n\n# Encouraged Uses\n\n*Many AI policies focus on what you can't do with AI. Instead, AI-positive companies should highlight specific ways employees are encouraged to use AI, organised by department or function. Make it clear this list is not exhaustive but illustrative.*\n\n**Example text for different functions:**\n\n| **Marketing** \u003Cbr>• Draft and refine marketing copy\u003Cbr>• Generate and iterate on creative concepts\u003Cbr>• Educating prospects and customers\u003Cbr>• Analyse market trends and customer feedback | **Sales** \u003Cbr>• Research target accounts\u003Cbr>• Personalise sales outreach\u003Cbr>• Negotiation strategy planning\u003Cbr>• Role playing customer calls |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| **R&D** \u003Cbr>• Experiment design and optimisation\u003Cbr>• Hypothesis generation and testing\u003Cbr>• Data analysis and visualisation | **Engineering** \u003Cbr>• Code assistance and review\u003Cbr>• Documentation generation\u003Cbr>• Product mock ups and user feedback\u003Cbr>• Problem solving and de-bugging |\n| **Legal** \u003Cbr>• Contract review and analysis\u003Cbr>• Due diligence support\u003Cbr>• Regulatory requirement analysis | **Finance** \u003Cbr>• Audit support and documentation\u003Cbr>• Month end closing processes\u003Cbr>• Data analysis and reconciliation\u003Cbr>• M&A support |\n\n# Data and IP Protection Guidelines\n\n*Frame these guidelines as enabling safe innovation rather than restrictive rules. Focus on practical approaches that protect both operational data and intellectual property while maintaining usability.*\n\n*Remind employees which tools you provide that have appropriate protections in place (such a Team/Enterprise accounts for Claude or ChatGPT)*\n\n**Example text:** \"When using AI tools, follow these practical guidelines to protect our information:\n\n## For Company Data\n\n1. Use approved enterprise AI tools for sensitive data. A full list is included at the end of this document, but specifically use our company [Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini] account rather than a personal account.\n2. Verify AI outputs before sharing externally - imagine it was provided to you by a junior intern - check, verify, edit before you pass it on as your own work.\n3. Break down complex tasks to minimize sharing of sensitive information - for example, if you want AI to build you a Python script to merge two customer data csvs, only pass the column headings rather than the full csvs.\n4. Use generic examples when seeking AI assistance with confidential matters\n\n## For Intellectual Property\n\n1. Don't share source code without removing basic business logic\n2. Use placeholder data when discussing proprietary processes\n3. Be generic when describing our unique business methods\n4. Document significant AI contributions to inventions\n5. Consider locally hosted AI tools for sensitive work\n6. **If you aren't sure - ask!** Get an immediate response in our [Slack|Teams #canidothis channel] or \"Can I chat it?\" GPT\n\nAnd for all sensitive information - report any accidental data exposure immediately - **let us help you assess and resolve the situation.\"**\n\n# Tool Selection and Approval\n\n*Create a streamlined process that enables quick adoption of newly released tools and models while maintaining oversight. Focus on enabling rather than controlling - it is always better that your people use tools within your visibility that outside of it.*\n\n**Example text:** \"We maintain a list of pre-approved AI tools for common use cases. If you find a new tool that you'd like to try that is not on the list:\n\n1. Submit a brief tool assessment form\n2. IT will review and respond within 2 business days\n3. Default is to approve unless specific risks are identified\"\n\n# Best Practices\n\n*Provide practical guidance that helps employees to use AI effectively. You will have a broader change enablement program so this is just to highlight the importance of sharing best practices.*\n\n**Example text:** \"To get the best results from AI:\n\n1. Be specific in your prompts\n2. Verify factual outputs (especially when relating to customer data)\n3. Learn from what works\n4. Use [ChatGPT Projects/Claude Projects/Gemini Gems] to provide context\n5. Share successful approaches with colleagues\n6. Start with small tasks and expand across your team's processes\n7. Document effective prompts for reuse\"\n\n# Training and Support\n\n*Use this section to highlight the company's commitment to helping all employees to succeed with AI.*\n\n**Example text:** \"We provide:\n\n1. Regular in person and virtual AI skills training\n2. An AI Ambassadors network in each team\n3. AI Business Partners aligned to each department\n4. Weekly Office Hours for AI-related questions\n5. Internal video/document library of best practices\n6. Weekly Lunch and Learn sessions in each of our buildings\"\n\n# Compliance and Monitoring\n\n*Keep this brief or it risks putting your teams off discussing their AI usage openly. Focus on enabling safe usage rather than enforcement.*\n\n**Example text:** \"We trust our employees to use AI responsibly. Our monitoring focuses on:\n\n1. Identifying successful use patterns to share\n2. Understanding tool effectiveness in our company's context\n3. Ensuring appropriate handling of sensitive data\n4. Supporting teams in using AI effectively\n\nIn short, you will be thanked and recognised for using AI - just be sensible and if you aren't sure - ask\"\n\n# Review and Updates\n\n*Highlight that the world of AI is moving fast and that this policy has to adapt as new tools and models are released.*\n\n**Example text:** \"This policy will be reviewed at least quarterly to:\n\n1. Include new AI capabilities\n2. Add successful use cases\n3. Update best practices\n4. Remove any outdated restrictions\n5. Incorporate team feedback\n\nThis AI policy is also provided as a [ChatGPT GPT/Claude Project] so if you have any questions about the current policy - ask there for the latest guidance.\"\n\n# Getting Help\n\n*Make it clear and easy for employees to get support. We want this policy to encourage your people to talk about their ideas, their experiments and to get advice.*\n\n**Example text:** \"For any AI-related questions or support:\n\n1. Contact your department's AI Business Partner\n2. Speak with your team's AI Ambassador\n3. Visit the AI resource centre on the Intranet\n4. Join the #ai-help [Slack|Teams channel]\n5. Attend the next AI Office Hours\n6. Email ai-help@company.com\"\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Approved Tools\n\n1. ChatGPT Business/Enterprise\n2. Claude Enterprise\n3. etc\n\n---\n\n# Implementation Notes\n\nWhen implementing this template:\n\n1. Customise the tone and content to match your company culture - we have written this as an encouraging AI-positive policy - if that is not your approach you'll want to change many of the examples.\n2. Add specific examples for your industry and company - especially in the encouraged use cases section.\n3. Update the approved tools section to those you have actually approved\n4. Consider creating a one pager or infographic for quick reference\n5. Create a custom GPT or Claude Project with this policy as knowledge for your employees to discuss with\n6. Link out to any training, list of AI Ambassadors and AI Business Partners and the Office Hours schedule\n\nRemember this is a starting point - you should adapt it based on your:\n\n1. Company size and structure\n2. Geographic location and regulations\n3. Industry requirements\n4. Regulatory environment\n5. Current AI maturity\n6. Risk tolerance\n7.

A Chief Technology Officer leads product and engineering. A Chief AI Officer drives AI adoption across every role in the organization - helping marketers use AI for campaigns, sales teams use AI for prospecting, finance teams use AI for analysis. The Chief AI Officer makes AI capabilities accessible and practical for everyone, not just technical teams.",{"question":1854,"answer":1855},"Why do most Chief AI Officer job descriptions fail to attract the right candidates?","Most job descriptions are filled with vague mission statements like 'drive AI strategy' and 'transform the organization' without specific deliverables. Strong candidates want to know exactly what they will build, who they will enable, and how success will be measured. Tactical specificity attracts doers. Vague vision statements attract talkers.",{"question":1857,"answer":1858},"What should we actually look for in a Chief AI Officer candidate?","Look for evidence of team building and program design, not just executive presentations. Ask candidates to describe a change enablement program they built from scratch and the adoption metrics they achieved. Ask about their approach to hiring and developing AI Business Partners. Ask about the last prompt they wrote (strong candidates use AI daily). Strong Chief AI Officers should be able to design a comprehensive adoption program, build the team to execute it, and coach employees on effective AI use.",{"question":1860,"answer":1861},"What are realistic first 90 days deliverables for a new Chief AI Officer?","A strong Chief AI Officer should establish the foundation in 90 days: select and license AI platforms, create governance framework, hire first AI Business Partners, recruit initial AI Ambassador cohort, deploy to pilot departments, and present measurable adoption metrics. The focus should be on building the team and programs that will scale, not trying to personally train hundreds of employees. Quick foundation-building enables sustained momentum, while waiting six months to assess wastes critical early adoption opportunity.",{"question":1863,"answer":1864},"Should this be a permanent executive role or a temporary transformation role?","This depends on your organization size and AI maturity. For companies with 1,000 to 10,000 employees, consider a three year term with clear success metrics. The role should make itself less necessary over time by building AI capability across the organization. If your Chief AI Officer is still the only person who knows how to use AI after two years, they have failed.",{"question":1866,"answer":1867},"How do we measure success for a Chief AI Officer?","Measure adoption breadth and depth, not strategy documents. Track how many employees use AI tools weekly, how many departments have deployed AI solutions, and how many hours saved across the organization. Measure business impact like sales cycle reduction, content production increase, and support ticket resolution time. Avoid vanity metrics like 'AI strategy roadmap completed' that do not reflect actual organizational change.",{"question":1869,"answer":1870},"What compensation range should we expect for a Chief AI Officer?","For mid-sized companies (1,000 to 10,000 employees), expect $300,000 to $500,000 total compensation for experienced Chief AI Officers. Early-career Chief AI Officers or those transitioning from other roles may accept $200,000 to $300,000. Enterprise organizations (over 10,000 employees) may pay $500,000 and above. Remember that recruitment takes 6 to 12 months and there is no guarantee the person will have the right industry experience.",{"question":1872,"answer":1873},"What is the alternative to hiring a Chief AI Officer?","Consider whether you need a permanent executive or AI leadership capabilities. A Digital Chief AI Officer platform provides immediate access to AI expertise, costs significantly less than hiring, requires no recruitment time, and scales with your needs. Some organizations start with a Digital Chief AI Officer to build initial capabilities, then hire a human Chief AI Officer once they understand exactly what the role requires.",[1636],{"title":1876,"content":1877,"button_label":1878,"button_link":713},"Need AI Leadership Without the Hiring Process?","Get immediate access to executive-level AI expertise with a Digital Chief AI Officer.

You will hire AI Business Partners who embed with departments, recruit AI Ambassadors from every team, and establish the governance and training infrastructure for sustained adoption. You will measure success by how many people use AI weekly, not by how many strategy presentations you create.\n\nIf you want to be a visionary who talks about AI transformation, this is not the role.

This section clarifies what we mean by tactical AI leadership and how it differs from other technology executive roles.*\n\n### Not a Chief Information Officer Role\n\nA Chief Information Officer manages IT infrastructure, security, and enterprise systems. This role is not about managing servers or implementing enterprise resource planning systems. This role is about making AI accessible and useful for everyone.\n\n### Not a Chief Technology Officer Role\n\nA Chief Technology Officer leads product development and engineering teams. This role is not about building AI products for customers. This role is about enabling internal teams to use AI for their work.\n\n### What This Role Actually Is\n\nYou will build and lead the AI Center of Excellence.

Make sure this is the right approach for your organization.*\n\n### Do you actually need a Chief AI Officer?\n\n**Consider hiring if:**\n\n- Your organization has 1,000+ employees\n- You have budget for $300,000 to $500,000 total compensation\n- You can wait 6 to 12 months for recruitment and onboarding\n- You need industry-specific AI expertise\n- You want to build permanent internal AI capability\n\n**Consider alternatives if:**\n\n- Your organization has fewer than 1,000 employees (may need AI capability, not a full executive)\n- You need AI leadership immediately (recruitment takes months)\n- You want to test AI adoption before committing to an executive hire\n- You are unsure what success looks like for this role\n- Budget is constrained but AI leadership is still needed\n\n### What are the alternatives?\n\n**Digital Chief AI Officer platforms** provide executive-level AI expertise immediately, cost significantly less than hiring, scale with your needs, and give you time to learn what you actually need from this role.\n\n**AI consultants** can provide project-based support for specific initiatives without the commitment of a permanent executive.\n\n**Upskilling existing leaders** may work if you have someone with the right skills and interest who can take on AI leadership as part of their current role.\n\n### How will you know if this hire is successful?\n\nDefine success criteria before you hire. If you cannot clearly articulate what this person will deliver in 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months, you are not ready to hire for this role.\n\n---\n\n## How to Apply\n\n[Your standard application instructions]\n\n**In your application, please include:**\n\n1. A specific example of building and leading a team that enabled organizational change\n2. Your approach to designing an AI Center of Excellence for our organization (structure, roles, first 90 days)\n3. An example of a change enablement program you designed and the adoption metrics you achieved\n4. How you would measure success for this role in 6 months and 12 months\n5. The last prompt you wrote and why it worked (we want leaders who use AI daily, not just talk about it)\n\nWe care more about what you have built and led than where you worked or what degrees you hold.\n\n---\n\n# Implementation Notes\n\nWhen implementing this job description:\n\n1. **Customize the compensation range** based on your geographic location, organization size, and market conditions. Research current Chief AI Officer compensation in your industry.\n\n2. **Adjust the team size and scope** based on your organization. A company with 1,000 employees needs a different approach than a company with 10,000 employees.\n\n3. **Add industry-specific context** throughout the description. A Chief AI Officer in healthcare faces different challenges than one in manufacturing or financial services.\n\n4. **Modify the success metrics** to align with your business objectives. Add industry-specific metrics that matter to your organization.\n\n5. **Be honest about your AI maturity** in the role description. Candidates want to know if they are building from scratch or scaling existing efforts.\n\n6. **Include your AI tool stack** so candidates know what platforms and tools you currently use or plan to use.\n\n7. **Clarify the reporting structure** and make clear this role has executive authority to drive change across departments.\n\nRemember this is a starting point - adapt it based on your:\n\n1. Organization size and structure\n2. Industry and regulatory environment\n3. Current AI maturity and existing initiatives\n4. Geographic location and talent market\n5. Budget and compensation philosophy\n6. Timeline and urgency for the hire\n7.

You'll typically see repeated pain points and use cases emerge after 3-4 interviews within the same function. For organization-wide discovery, aim for at least 2-3 representatives from each major department (Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations, HR, etc.). Quality matters more than quantity - thorough interviews with engaged employees yield better insights than rushed conversations with many people.",{"question":2033,"answer":2034},"Should I interview senior leaders or individual contributors first?","Start with individual contributors and mid-level managers who do the actual work daily. They have the most detailed knowledge of repetitive tasks, time-wasters, and workflow friction points. Senior leaders often have strategic perspectives but may be disconnected from day-to-day operational pain points. Interview executives later to validate findings and identify strategic-level AI applications. The best use cases typically come from people closest to the work.",{"question":2036,"answer":2037},"How do I position these interviews so employees don't worry about being replaced by AI?","Frame the conversation as an opportunity to eliminate tedious work and enhance their role, not replace it. Open with: 'This is not an evaluation - we want to understand your daily challenges and explore how AI could make your job more enjoyable and strategic.' Emphasize that AI should handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks so they can focus on higher-value work that requires human judgment, creativity, and relationship skills. Invite participants to your AI Ambassador program to make them partners in the transformation, not subjects of it.",{"question":2039,"answer":2040},"What if employees say 'I don't know how AI could help with my work'?","That's completely normal - most employees aren't AI experts. That's why this template focuses on discovering their tasks and pain points, not asking them to identify AI solutions. Your job is to ask: 'What takes the most time?', 'What do you put off?', 'What's repetitive?' The AI application ideas come later when you analyze the patterns. Sometimes the best discoveries come from people who say 'I don't think AI applies to my role' - they often describe highly repetitive processes they've stopped noticing.",{"question":2042,"answer":2043},"How long should each interview take?","Plan for 30-45 minutes per interview. Daily tasks take 10-15 minutes to explore thoroughly, weekly and monthly tasks another 10-15 minutes, and pain points plus wrap-up take the final 10-15 minutes. If you're short on time, focus deeply on daily tasks (where the highest-frequency opportunities exist) and pain points. Don't rush - a thoughtful 30-minute conversation reveals more than a hurried 15-minute checklist.",{"question":2045,"answer":2046},"Should I share examples of AI use cases before or during the interview?","Wait until after you've asked about their tasks and pain points. If you share examples first, you'll anchor their thinking and may miss unique opportunities specific to their workflow. Let them describe their work in their own terms first. After exploring their tasks, you can share relevant examples: 'Other teams have used AI for [similar task] - does that resonate with your workflow?' This approach uncovers both expected and surprising use cases.",{"question":2048,"answer":2049},"What should I do with the interview findings?","Create a centralized database or spreadsheet tracking: function, role, task frequency, pain point severity, and estimated time savings. Look for patterns across interviews - use cases mentioned by multiple people in different teams are high-priority candidates. Cluster similar use cases (e.g., all content generation, all data analysis, all scheduling/coordination) to identify horizontal AI solutions that benefit multiple teams. Prioritize based on frequency × impact × ease of implementation. Share aggregated findings back to participants to build engagement and validate priorities.",{"question":2051,"answer":2052},"How do I identify which use cases to prioritize for implementation?","Use a simple scoring framework: Frequency (daily=3, weekly=2, monthly=1) × Impact (hours saved or quality improvement) × Ease (1-5 scale, with 5=very easy). High-frequency, high-impact, easy-to-implement use cases are your quick wins. Also consider: (1) Use cases mentioned by multiple people across different teams, (2) Tasks people actively avoid or complain about, (3) Work that happens outside normal hours because there's no time during the day. Quick wins build momentum for more complex use cases later.",{"question":2054,"answer":2055},"Can this template be used for remote/async interviews?","Yes, but synchronous conversations (video call or in-person) work best for discovery interviews. Real-time dialogue lets you ask follow-up questions, notice patterns, and explore unexpected insights that emerge. If async is necessary, turn the template into a structured questionnaire and follow up with brief video calls to clarify interesting responses. Alternatively, use the template as an async 'homework' exercise before a shorter synchronous discussion - employees prepare their task lists in advance, then you explore pain points and opportunities in real-time.",{"question":2057,"answer":2058},"Should I record these interviews or just take notes?","Recording (with permission) is valuable but not essential. If you record, clearly explain it's only for your reference to ensure accuracy - not for evaluation or sharing widely. Many people are more candid without recording. Strong note-taking works well: use the template as your notes structure, capture specific task descriptions verbatim (especially when they describe pain points), and mark high-priority items with asterisks or highlights. Immediately after each interview, spend 5 minutes summarizing key insights while they're fresh - this synthesis is more valuable than transcripts.",[1636],{"google_doc":2061},{"url":2062,"label":1713},"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiSZ8upU5W2OeVfSPXh3jh2Lqpn9qRi86Pe2c0NgKII/edit?usp=sharing",{"title":2064,"content":2065,"button_label":1717,"button_link":713},"Need Help Implementing AI Use Case Discovery?","Our AI transformation specialists help organizations systematically identify, prioritize, and implement high-impact AI use cases across every function.

Don't only interview \"tech-savvy\" employees - often the best insights come from people doing highly repetitive manual work.\n\n2. **Schedule appropriately**: 30-45 minutes is ideal. Book meetings as \"AI opportunity discovery\" or \"workflow improvement discussion\" - avoid calling it an \"AI interview\" which may intimidate some participants.\n\n3. **Prepare your mindset**: You're not looking for people who already know AI solutions. You're looking for patterns of repetitive work, manual data handling, content creation, scheduling, analysis, or communication tasks that consume time.\n\n## During Interviews\n\n1. **Lead with curiosity, not solutions**: Don't suggest AI applications too early. First understand their actual workflow, then identify opportunities afterward.\n\n2. **Ask \"why\" and \"how\" questions**: When they mention a task, dig deeper: \"How long does that typically take?\" \"Why is that difficult?\" \"How often does this happen?\"\n\n3. **Listen for specific language**: Pay attention when people say:\n   - \"I spend hours on...\"\n   - \"This is so repetitive...\"\n   - \"I wish I could just...\"\n   - \"I have to manually...\"\n   - \"I'm always searching for...\"\n\n4. **Don't promise solutions**: Say \"That's really helpful context\" instead of \"AI can definitely solve that.\" Set expectations that you're gathering insights, not committing to specific implementations.\n\n## After Interviews\n\n1. **Consolidate findings quickly**: Within 24 hours, capture key insights while the conversation is fresh. Use a simple spreadsheet with columns: Function | Role | Daily Tasks | Weekly Tasks | Monthly Tasks | Top Pain Points | AI Opportunity Areas | Priority.\n\n2. **Look for patterns across roles**: The same use case appearing across multiple departments (e.g., \"summarizing meeting notes\") signals high-value, horizontal AI opportunities.\n\n3. **Categorize by AI capability type**:\n   - **Content generation**: Writing, emails, reports, documentation\n   - **Data analysis**: Extracting insights, creating summaries, identifying patterns\n   - **Research & information retrieval**: Finding documents, answering questions, gathering data\n   - **Administrative coordination**: Scheduling, reminders, status updates\n   - **Repetitive processing**: Data entry, formatting, quality checks\n\n4. **Prioritize with a simple framework**:\n   - **Quick wins**: High frequency + Low complexity (daily tasks that are straightforward to automate)\n   - **High impact**: Significant time savings or quality improvement (even if more complex)\n   - **Strategic**: Unlocks higher-value work or supports business priorities\n\n5. **Share back with participants**: Close the loop by sending aggregated findings (anonymized) and next steps. This builds engagement and validates that their input mattered.\n\n## Adaptation Tips\n\nCustomize this template based on your:\n\n1. **Organization size**: Smaller organizations (\u003C 100 people) can interview more comprehensively. Larger organizations should focus on representative samples per function.\n\n2. **Industry context**: Add industry-specific task examples to the framework. Manufacturing might emphasize quality control and equipment monitoring; professional services might focus on client deliverables and proposal development.\n\n3. **AI maturity level**: For AI beginners, spend more time on the introduction explaining what AI can and can't do. For more advanced organizations, ask about current AI usage and barriers to adoption.\n\n4. **Cultural factors**: Some cultures are more direct about pain points; others require more rapport-building before people share frustrations. Adapt your interview style accordingly.\n\n5. **Remote vs. in-person**: Video interviews work well but lose some spontaneous follow-up opportunities. In-person allows better reading of body language and energy when discussing pain points.\n\nRemember: The goal isn't to become an AI expert - it's to become an expert in your employees' workflows. AI solutions follow naturally from deep workflow understanding.","src/content/templates/ai-use-case-discovery.md","ffed94a2f414051e",{"html":2070,"metadata":2071},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>NOTE\u003C/strong>: To use this template, copy the content using the “Copy page” button above, open the Google Doc to make your own copy, or customize the framework below for your organization.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"functional-team-ai-use-case-discovery\">Functional Team AI Use Case Discovery\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>This template provides a structured approach to discovering AI opportunities through systematic interviews with employees across your organization.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"interview-framework\">Interview Framework\u003C/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Ctable>\u003Cthead>\u003Ctr>\u003Cth align=\"left\">\u003Cstrong>Interviewee:\u003C/strong>\u003C/th>\u003Cth align=\"left\">\u003Cstrong>Team/Function:\u003C/strong>\u003C/th>\u003C/tr>\u003C/thead>\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd align=\"left\">\u003Cstrong>Role:\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd align=\"left\">\u003Cstrong>Date:\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003C/tbody>\u003C/table>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Interviewer Context Setting:\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“This is not an evaluation, but an opportunity to improve your working experience.

Participants gain practical prompt engineering skills, hands-on AI experience, and templates for ongoing development.",{"question":2213,"answer":2214},"How much does it cost to run a prompt hackathon?","Primary costs are AI platform access (ranging from $20/month per user for individual accounts to enterprise pricing for corporate solutions) and facilitator time. Room costs and materials are minimal (post-its, markers, standard meeting room). The guide helps you evaluate platform options based on your budget, with implementation tips for each approach. Most organizations find the productivity gains from improved processes quickly offset the modest investment.",{"question":2216,"answer":2217},"Can I run this hackathon virtually or does it need to be in-person?","While in-person is preferred for energy and collaboration, the hackathon can run virtually. The guide includes adaptation notes for virtual delivery.

Track these across Week 1, Weeks 2-4, and Month 2+ for complete visibility.",{"question":2222,"answer":2223},"What happens after the first hackathon? How do I scale this across my organization?","The guide includes a scaling framework for organization-wide rollout. After your first successful hackathon: (1) Collect and share success stories to build momentum; (2) Create a prompt library for teams to share learnings; (3) Run additional hackathons with other teams/functions; (4) Develop internal champions who can facilitate future sessions; (5) Establish regular 'prompt sharing' sessions for ongoing learning. Many organizations start with one team, refine their approach, then scale to monthly hackathons across departments.",{"question":2225,"answer":2226},"What if participants get stuck or can't think of a good use case during the workshop?","The guide includes facilitation tips for common challenges. If someone struggles with use case selection, have them talk through a 'day-in-the-life' to identify repetitive tasks. The pre-work survey should give them ideas to start with. If prompts become too broad or complex, bring participants back to a single simple task they do today. If participants get too ambitious, refocus them on improving an existing workflow rather than creating something entirely new. The key is starting with something they already do regularly.",[1810,1636],{"google_doc":2229},{"url":2230,"label":2231},"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1an_ES8gUTB7_bHTlgYMIRlGuHOgN15KgQZ5xXCdHjZI/edit?usp=sharing","Open Full Guide in Google Docs",{"title":2233,"content":2234,"button_label":1717,"button_link":713},"Need Help Accelerating AI Adoption Across Your Organization?","While this guide provides everything you need to run successful prompt hackathons, Kowalah's Digital Chief AI Officer can help you develop comprehensive AI training strategies, build organizational capabilities at scale, and ensure your workshops connect to broader AI transformation initiatives.","***NOTE**: This template links to a comprehensive Google Doc with all facilitator materials, scripts, and templates.

Revenue growth requiring proportional headcount growth creates unsustainable scaling patterns that limit your business agility and profitability. Meanwhile, you personally use ChatGPT for strategic thinking because it works - but your organization isn't capturing this productivity multiplication across your entire workforce.\n\n## The Growth Constraint Challenge\n\nAs a CEO, you're facing the fundamental scalability challenge:\n- **Revenue-Headcount Link**: Growth requires proportional hiring, limiting scalability and margins\n- **Personal AI Success**: You use ChatGPT effectively for strategic thinking and decision-making\n- **Organizational Gap**: Your workforce isn't accelerating at the same pace as your personal productivity\n- **Competitive Pressure**: Competitors who enable their workforce first will move faster than those still hiring\n\n## Why Hiring More People Isn't The Answer\n\nThe traditional approach to scaling business output - adding more people - creates compounding challenges:\n- **AI Uncertainty**: You know AI is critical but lack clarity on where and how to start organizationally\n- **Cost Structure**: Linear headcount growth destroys margins and operational efficiency\n- **Coordination Complexity**: More people create exponentially more coordination overhead\n- **Competitive Risk**: While you're evaluating options, competitors are already implementing and gaining advantage\n\n**Your personal ChatGPT experience proves there's a better way.** You get strategic value not from having more people, but from having an AI creative thinking partner that amplifies your capabilities.\n\n## The Workforce Transformation Solution\n\nTransform your entire organization by giving every employee access to AI-powered creative thinking and knowledge partnership:\n\n### Creative Thinking Partnership, Not Just Tools\n- **Knowledge Amplification**: Each employee gains access to unlimited expertise and analytical capability\n- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: ChatGPT provides strategic thinking support, scenario analysis, and informed perspectives\n- **Structured Enablement**: Systematic training on AI collaboration and knowledge work across all departments\n- **Continuous Learning**: Ongoing development of AI partnership skills and organizational capability building\n\n### Breaking the Revenue-Headcount Link\n- **Output Scaling**: Increase capacity without proportional headcount increases\n- **Cost Optimization**: Improve margins through productivity gains rather than hiring costs\n- **Speed Advantage**: Move faster than competitors who are still in hiring cycles\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Accelerate existing teams rather than coordinating larger ones\n\n### Measurable Business Impact\n- **Productivity Metrics**: Track individual and team acceleration across all departments\n- **Financial Returns**: Measure revenue growth without corresponding headcount increases\n- **Competitive Advantage**: Capture market opportunities while competitors are still hiring\n- **Workforce Satisfaction**: Employees become more effective and engaged with AI partnership\n\n## Executive Outcomes That Scale Your Business\n\n- **Revenue Growth Without Headcount**: Increase output capacity with existing workforce through systematic ChatGPT adoption\n- **Competitive Speed Advantage**: Move faster than competitors who are hiring by accelerating existing team capabilities\n- **Cost Structure Optimization**: Improve margins through productivity multiplication rather than proportional hiring costs\n- **Workforce Transformation**: Employees become more effective and engaged with ChatGPT creative thinking partnership\n- **Board-Ready Results**: Demonstrable productivity gains and financial impact from workforce acceleration\n\n## Ready to Transform Your Growth Model?\n\nSchedule a strategic conversation about breaking the revenue-headcount growth link.

They download it on mobile, use it for work tasks, and bypass your official AI rollout because it works better than the alternatives. You can't stop this without taking away personal devices, which isn't realistic.\n\nThe strategic question isn't how to prevent shadow AI usage - it's how to guide it toward enterprise AI excellence while achieving your governance, security, and organizational objectives.\n\n## The CIO's AI Adoption Reality\n\nAs a technology leader, you're facing a unique organizational challenge:\n\n- **Shadow AI Usage**: Employees use personal ChatGPT (85% of mobile LLM downloads) while resisting official Copilot or internal AI tools\n- **Governance Gaps**: Personal device AI usage creates security, compliance, and data governance challenges outside your control\n- **Adoption Resistance**: Teams prefer ChatGPT's interface and capabilities over enterprise alternatives you've implemented\n- **Capacity Constraints**: Overwhelming requests for AI support, training, and implementation that your team cannot fulfill\n\n## Why Fighting Employee Preferences Doesn't Work\n\nTraditional IT governance approaches - blocking, restricting, or mandating alternatives - create organizational resistance rather than alignment:\n\n- **User Experience Reality**: ChatGPT's interface and capabilities exceed most enterprise alternatives\n- **Mobile Dominance**: 85% of LLM usage happens on mobile devices where you have limited control\n- **Productivity Evidence**: Employees see measurable productivity gains from ChatGPT that they don't want to lose\n- **Change Resistance**: Forcing inferior tools creates resistance and reduces overall AI adoption across the organization\n\n**Your employees have already chosen the winning solution.** The strategic opportunity is guiding them to use it within enterprise governance frameworks.\n\n## Strategic ChatGPT Enterprise Approach\n\nTransform shadow AI chaos into enterprise AI excellence through strategic alignment rather than technological force:\n\n### Enterprise Governance with User Satisfaction\n- **ChatGPT Enterprise**: Same interface and capabilities employees prefer with enterprise security, SSO, and data controls\n- **Compliance Integration**: European data residency, SOC 2 compliance, and governance frameworks that meet enterprise requirements\n- **Strategic Rollout**: Change management that works with employee preferences rather than against them\n- **Adoption Success**: High organizational adoption rates through preference alignment rather than mandate enforcement\n\n### Expert Capacity Augmentation\n- **Implementation Support**: Expert Requests provide burst capacity for AI initiatives your team cannot absorb\n- **Ready-to-Deploy Solutions**: AI Accelerators deliver immediate value through pre-built enterprise AI workflows\n- **Strategic Focus**: You lead AI strategy and governance while experts handle implementation details\n- **Scalable Approach**: Grow AI capabilities without overwhelming existing technology teams\n\n## CIO Leadership Outcomes\n\n- **Governance Achievement**: Implement enterprise security and compliance while enabling preferred AI adoption\n- **Organizational Alignment**: Transform technology leadership from gatekeeper to strategic enabler\n- **Strategic Positioning**: Lead AI transformation that achieves both governance and user satisfaction objectives\n- **Capacity Optimization**: Focus on strategic technology leadership while experts handle implementation workload\n- **Implementation Success**: Achieve high adoption rates through preference alignment rather than technological force\n\n## Ready to Transform Shadow AI into Strategic Advantage?\n\nSchedule a strategic conversation about transforming shadow ChatGPT usage into enterprise AI excellence. We'll discuss your specific governance requirements, explore implementation approaches that work with employee preferences, and provide immediate insights for achieving both compliance and organizational adoption objectives.\n\n**This is a strategic technology leadership discussion** - focused on organizational alignment, governance excellence, and sustainable AI adoption at enterprise scale.","src/content/solutions/for-cios.md","0d35e6e12dafdf09",{"html":2717,"metadata":2718},"\u003Ch1 id=\"solve-the-shadow-chatgpt-challenge-strategic-ai-governance-for-cios\">Solve the Shadow ChatGPT Challenge: Strategic AI Governance for CIOs\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Your employees are already using ChatGPT on their personal devices.
