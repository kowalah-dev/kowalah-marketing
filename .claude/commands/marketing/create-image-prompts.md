# Command: Create Image Prompts

## Goal

To automatically generate detailed AI image prompts and coordinate Playwright screenshot capture based on Astro content file image requirements, ensuring visual consistency with Kowalah's executive brand and organized asset management.

## Command Syntax

### Complete Image Generation (Recommended)
```bash
/create-image-prompts [astro-content-file]
```
**Example:** `/create-image-prompts src/content/product/digital-caio.md`
*Generates AI prompts and captures screenshots for all image requirements*

### Selective Generation
```bash
/create-image-prompts [astro-content-file] --screenshots-only
/create-image-prompts [astro-content-file] --ai-only
/create-image-prompts [astro-content-file] --batch
```
- **`--screenshots-only`** - Only capture application interface screenshots via Playwright
- **`--ai-only`** - Only generate AI image prompts for executive/business scenes
- **`--batch`** - Process multiple content files (provide directory path)

## Process Workflow

### 1. Content File Analysis
1. **Parse Frontmatter** - Extract all image field requirements from YAML
2. **Identify Image Types** - Categorize as product screenshots, AI-generated scenes, or icons
3. **Map Directory Structure** - Determine correct `/public/images/` subdirectories
4. **Extract Specifications** - Get dimensions, alt text, and purpose requirements

### 2. AI Image Prompt Generation
1. **Apply Visual Style Guide** - Reference `/docs/context/executive-visual-style-guide.md`
2. **Generate Detailed Prompts** - Create comprehensive prompts for each AI-generated image
3. **Include Technical Specs** - Add dimensions, format, and style requirements
4. **Provide Implementation Guide** - Instructions for using prompts with AI generation tools

### 3. Playwright Screenshot Automation
1. **Navigate to Application** - Use Playwright MCP to access live Kowalah application at app.kowalah.com (NOT kowalah.com)
2. **Await Authentication** - Wait for user to login and access dashboard at app.kowalah.com/new
3. **Configure Viewports** - Set exact dimensions: 1200x800px (hero), 1000x750px (screenshots)
4. **Capture Multiple Views** - Take varied screenshots showing different capabilities and workflows
5. **Auto-move Files** - Use bash commands to move from Playwright temp directory to final location

### 4. Asset Organization
1. **Directory Creation** - Ensure correct `/public/images/` subdirectory structure exists
2. **File Naming** - Use consistent naming that matches content file references
3. **Optimization** - Compress images for web performance while maintaining quality
4. **Validation** - Verify all required images are generated and accessible

## Image Type Classification

### Product Screenshots (Playwright Automation)
**Directory:** `/public/images/product/`
- **`mockups/`** - Hero product interface shots, polished dashboard views
- **`screenshots/`** - Raw interface captures, feature demonstrations  
- **`demos/`** - How-it-works process screenshots, user flow captures

**Playwright Configuration:**
