## AI Image Generation Best Practices

### Preventing Text Overlays in Midjourney

**Critical Rules to Avoid Unwanted Text Generation:**

1. **Never use quoted speech or dialogue** in prompts
   - ❌ Bad: `Expression conveys "I'm the strategic leader"`
   - ✅ Good: `Expression conveys strategic leadership confidence`

2. **Avoid prescriptive messaging phrases**
   - ❌ Bad: `Face shows "compliance achieved, risks mitigated"`
   - ✅ Good: `Face shows compliance satisfaction and risk mitigation relief`

3. **Use descriptive emotion words instead of quoted outcomes**
   - ❌ Bad: `Conveys "my team can focus on strategy"`
   - ✅ Good: `Conveys strategic focus and operational relief`

4. **Explicitly request pure photography**
   - Always include: `No text overlays, no graphic elements, pure photography`
   - Add: `Professional portrait photography, not illustration or graphic design`

5. **Remove any text-like elements from scene descriptions**
   - ❌ Bad: `Dashboard showing "85% adoption rate" text`
   - ✅ Good: `Dashboard displaying adoption metrics in background, blurred and out of focus`

6. **Focus on visual and emotional description only**
   - Describe what you see, not what text would say
   - Use emotional descriptors: relief, confidence, satisfaction, pride, calm
   - Avoid business jargon that could trigger text: KPI, metrics, dashboard labels

**Template Addition for Text Prevention:**
```
Photography Specifications:
- Pure photographic portrait without text overlays or graphic elements
- Natural realistic photography, not illustration or graphic design
- Clean professional headshot quality
- No text, no graphics, authentic photography only
```
