# Expert Requests Page Design Document

## Page Overview

**Page Name:** Expert Requests  
**URL Path:** `/product/expert-requests`  
**Content Strategy:** Astro Collection (Static) - using existing `product` collection schema  
**Primary Objective:** Educate prospects and customers about "done for you" AI implementation services, drive demo bookings and upgrade conversations  
**Target Audience:** AI strategy leads (CEOs without CIO, CIOs, AI Center of Excellence heads) who need immediate delivery capacity  
**Position in User Journey:** Mid-funnel education for prospects evaluating full platform capabilities, or existing customers considering service upgrades

## Content Architecture Decision

**Rationale for Astro Collection Approach:**
- Expert request examples and service descriptions change infrequently
- Performance-critical for SEO and user experience
- Content fits perfectly within existing `product` collection schema
- Aligns with other product pages (Digital CAIO, Accelerators) for consistent experience

**Collection Type:** `product` collection  
**Schema Utilization:** Leverages existing flexible product schema with capabilities, use cases, competitive advantages, and social proof sections  
**Custom Schema Requirements:** None - existing schema supports all content requirements

## Key Messages

**Primary Value Proposition:** "Get AI work done for you - no SOWs, no delays, just results"

**Supporting Messages:**
1. **Immediate Access:** Skip procurement friction with pre-purchased capacity
2. **Burst Capacity:** Scale your AI team instantly without hiring
3. **Expert Delivery:** Professional-grade prompts, GPTs, apps, and training delivered in 7-14 days

**Competitive Differentiators:**
- No statement of work or purchase order required
- Pre-contracted capacity eliminates project initiation delays  
- Access to skills and capacity your internal team doesn't have
- Fixed quarterly allocation removes cost uncertainty
- 36-hour strategy call booking + 7-14 day delivery

**Messaging Framework Alignment:**
- **Benefit 2:** "Get Expert AI Skills Instantly Without Hiring"
- **Use Case 2:** "Building Organization-Wide AI Competency"
- **vs. AI Consultants:** Ongoing partnership vs. project-based, predictable costs vs. variable fees
