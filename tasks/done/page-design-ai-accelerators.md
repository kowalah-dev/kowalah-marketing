# AI Accelerators Product Page Design Document

## Page Overview

**Page Name:** AI Accelerators  
**URL Path:** `/product/accelerators`  
**Content Strategy:** Astro Content Collection (static page using existing `productCollection` schema)  
**Primary Objective:** Drive free trial signups and educate users about accelerator value for tier upgrades  
**Target Audience:** AI leadership teams, Centers of Excellence, L&D professionals, and senior leaders driving organizational AI adoption  
**Position in User Journey:** Product exploration phase - users evaluating Kowalah's comprehensive AI adoption toolkit

## Content Architecture Decision

**Approach:** Astro Content Collection (`productCollection`)  
**Rationale:** 
- Static content that changes infrequently (quarterly updates)
- SEO performance critical for product discovery
- Leverages existing proven schema from Digital CAIO page
- Allows for rich media integration (videos, screenshots, interactive elements)
- Version-controlled content for consistent messaging

**Schema Utilization:** Full `productCollection` schema with emphasis on:
- `capabilities` array for accelerator categories
- `how_it_works` with video demo integration
- `use_cases` for specific accelerator examples
- `competitive_advantage` for "Lego kit" positioning
- `conversion` section for trial-to-paid upgrade messaging
