# ChatGPT Training Page Design Document

## Page Overview

**Page Name:** ChatGPT Training
**URL Path:** `/services/chatgpt-training`
**Content Strategy:** Static Astro page (following existing services pattern)
**Primary Objective:** Convert prospects who need ChatGPT skill development into training customers, either standalone or as part of larger engagements
**Target Audience:** Learning & Development leaders, HR executives, and C-suite leaders at companies with 1,000-10,000 employees who have or plan to deploy ChatGPT Enterprise

## Content Architecture Decision

**Approach:** Static Astro page with hardcoded content data
**Rationale:** Following the proven pattern of `/services/chatgpt-change-enablement.astro` for consistency and performance
