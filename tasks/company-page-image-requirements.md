# Company Page Image Requirements
**ChatGPT Rollout & Training Specialists Repositioning**

## Image Inventory & Requirements

### 1. About Section Image
**Current:** `/images/company/stats.png`
**Purpose:** Support "From AI Chaos to ChatGPT Excellence" narrative
**Recommendation:** Replace with ChatGPT transformation visual

**New Image Concept:**
- **Subject:** Before/after split showing transformation journey
- **Left side:** Frustrated executive with multiple AI tools (Copilot, Gemini icons), shadow ChatGPT usage chaos
- **Right side:** Same executive confident, unified ChatGPT interface, organized workflow
- **Mood:** Problem → Solution, Chaos → Order
- **Size:** 490x559px (portrait orientation)

**Alternative Concept:**
- Dashboard showing ChatGPT Business/Enterprise deployment metrics
- Real-time adoption stats, custom GPT usage, employee engagement
- Professional, clean, executive-ready reporting interface

### 2. Founder Story Image
**New:** `/images/company/founder.png` (needs creation)
**Purpose:** Humanize Charlie's people-first expertise and Google Workspace background
**Critical:** This is the anchor for credibility and trust

**Image Concept:**
- **Subject:** Charlie Cowan professional portrait or in-action training shot
- **Setting Option 1:** Professional headshot - approachable, consultative expertise
- **Setting Option 2:** Charlie facilitating in-person ChatGPT workshop, engaging with participants
- **Mood:** Approachable expert, hands-on educator, people-focused (not tech-focused)
- **Size:** 490x559px (portrait orientation)

**Photography Notes:**
- Warm, natural lighting (reference: Fujifilm color science)
- Authentic energy - not corporate sterile
- If in-action: show genuine training moment, participants engaged
- Convey "sits next to people" hands-on approach

---

### 3. Why Section Image
**Current:** `/images/company/why.png`
**Purpose:** Illustrate hands-on, people-first ChatGPT transformation
**Recommendation:** Replace with in-person training/enablement visual

**New Image Concept:**
- **Subject:** Hands-on ChatGPT training session - Charlie or team member with client employees
- **Key Elements:**
  - Screens showing ChatGPT interface (voice, projects, custom GPTs)
  - Participants' "aha moment" expressions - discovery and realization
  - Diverse employees (HR, finance, sales) - not just IT folks
  - In-person, collaborative atmosphere (not virtual/remote)
- **Mood:** Discovery, capability revelation, "I didn't know it could do that"
- **Size:** 490x559px (portrait orientation)

**Alternative Concept:**
- Close-up of ChatGPT advanced features being demonstrated
- Projects interface, custom GPT builder, voice conversation UI
- Focus on the "electricity" - what you can plug in, not the infrastructure

---

### 4. Image Slider (Multiple Team/Training Images)
**Current:** Repeated placeholder images (image-1.png, image-2.png, image-3.png)
**Purpose:** Show breadth of ChatGPT transformation across departments and contexts
**Recommendation:** Replace all with diverse ChatGPT enablement scenes

**New Slider Images (6-8 unique images needed):**

**Image Set 1: Department-Specific Training**
- Finance team using ChatGPT for month-end reconciliations
- HR professionals building job description GPTs
- Marketing team planning events with ChatGPT Projects
- Sales reps practicing objection handling with voice

**Image Set 2: Transformation Moments**
- Executive leadership ChatGPT strategy session
- AI Ambassadors training their peers (train-the-trainer)
- Cross-team collaboration using custom GPTs
- Before/after: frustrated Copilot user → engaged ChatGPT power user

**Photography Requirements:**
- Mix of training sessions, hands-on work, collaborative moments
- Real employees in authentic work environments (not staged)
- Diversity across roles, industries, ages (per visual style guide)
- ChatGPT interface visible where appropriate
- Expressions of discovery, confidence, transformation
- Size: Consistent dimensions for slider (suggest 800x600px or 1200x800px)

---

### 5. Mission Section (No Image Currently)
**Optional Enhancement:** Consider adding visual element
**Purpose:** Reinforce global partnership and AI-first future vision

**Possible Visual Additions:**
- World map showing UK/US presence with expansion vision
- Conceptual illustration: Humans + AI partnership
- Data visualization: Growth trajectory, client transformations
- Keep it subtle - mission is content-focused, not image-heavy

---

## Image Creation Priority Order

### CRITICAL (Must Have):
1. **Founder Portrait/Story Image** - Establishes credibility and trust
2. **Why Section Training Image** - Core differentiator (hands-on approach)
3. **About Section Transformation Visual** - Problem/solution narrative

### HIGH PRIORITY (Should Have):
4. **Image Slider Set** - Demonstrates breadth and diversity of impact
   - Minimum 4 unique images showing different departments/contexts
   - Can start with 4 and expand to 8 later

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have):
5. **Mission Section Visual** - Enhancement for global vision narrative

---

## Placeholder Strategy (Until Images Ready)

**Temporary Image Paths:**
- Keep existing images but note they don't match new positioning
- Consider generic stock photos aligned with new messaging:
  - Business training sessions
  - Collaborative workshops
  - Technology adoption moments
  - Diverse professional environments

**When New Images Are Ready:**
Simply update the file paths in `/src/content/company/-index.md`:
```yaml
about:
  image: "/images/company/chatgpt-transformation.png"  # New image

story:
  image: "/images/company/founder.png"  # New Charlie image

why:
  image: "/images/company/hands-on-training.png"  # New training image

slider:
  - "/images/company/finance-team-chatgpt.png"
  - "/images/company/hr-gpt-building.png"
  - "/images/company/marketing-event-planning.png"
  - "/images/company/sales-voice-practice.png"
  # etc.
```
