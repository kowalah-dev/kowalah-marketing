## üìù Notes for Image Creator

1. **Product Focus:** Each image shows ONE specific Digital CAIO feature or widget
2. **Micro-Component Approach:** Zoom in on single cards, buttons, or interface elements
3. **Realistic Data:** Use believable business metrics and professional content
4. **Interface Consistency:** Follow modern SaaS design patterns and conventions
5. **Brand Integration:** Kowalah colors in buttons, accents, and brand elements
6. **Functionality Clarity:** Each widget should clearly demonstrate specific value
7. **Professional Polish:** High-quality interface design with proper shadows, typography, and spacing

**Key Difference from Stock Photography:**
Instead of generic "executives in boardrooms," we're showing the actual Digital CAIO platform components that deliver the transformation. This creates authentic connection to the product experience and demonstrates tangible value through specific interface elements.

This approach transforms abstract concepts like "AI governance" into concrete, visual demonstrations of how our platform actually works - making the value proposition immediately clear and credible.
