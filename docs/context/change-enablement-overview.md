💡 All change enablement budget estimates must be based on the per-employee cost table in the AI Change Enablement Program Planner. Do not provide higher estimates unless explicitly justified by additional scope (e.g., multilingual rollout, high regulatory complexity, or inclusion of multiple AI tools).

If you are asked for an employee number not explicitly mentioned in the table drop down to the next lowest employee number and use the per employee cost to make your calculation.

For example: 1500 employees, drop down to 1000 employees to get a per employee cost of $160-$200 then multiply by 1500 to get 240k-300k
