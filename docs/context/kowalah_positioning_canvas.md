### 1. Competitive Alternatives

**What customers do when they don't buy from you:**

- **Internal IT teams handling ChatGPT rollouts alone** (technical focus, lacks business context, limited change management expertise)
- **Basic AI training consultants** (generic AI knowledge, one-time training, no ongoing support)
- **Traditional change management firms** (lack ChatGPT-specific expertise, expensive, project-based)
- **DIY approach with current tools** (continuing with failed Copilot/Gemini rollouts, accepting shadow AI usage)
- **Doing nothing** (paralyzed by complexity, hoping the shadow AI problem resolves itself)

### 2. Unique Attributes

**What you have that alternatives don't:**

- **ChatGPT-specific business expertise** - Deep knowledge of advanced ChatGPT capabilities (voice, projects, custom GPTs, data analysis) that others miss
- **Business context focus** - Inspire individual and team-level usage around specific business processes, not just technical implementation
- **"I didn't know it could do that" revelation** - Capability discovery that shows ChatGPT is "leagues ahead" of Copilot/Gemini
- **16-week comprehensive change enablement program** - Complete organizational transformation including Ambassadors, incentive programs, culture change
- **Ongoing managed services partnership** - Expert Requests for continuous GPT/prompt development, maintaining momentum long-term
- **Implementation confidence building** - Help IT/InfoSec/Legal teams feel confident about OpenAI's enterprise credentials
- **Measurable adoption outcomes** - 100% training completion rates, 15-20 custom GPTs created within 6 months
