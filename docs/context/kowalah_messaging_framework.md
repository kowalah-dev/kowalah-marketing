## USE CASE MESSAGING BUILDING BLOCKS

### USE CASE 1: The Shadow ChatGPT Situation

**IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS**:
- **Discovery**: Show accelerator examples that spark "I had no idea it could do that" moments
- **Ideation**: Teams brainstorm applications for their specific contexts and challenges
- **Development**: Expert Requests deliver custom GPTs, prompts, or hands-on training workshops
- **Expansion**: Success stories spread across departments, creating pipeline of new use cases

**MEASURABLE RESULTS**:
- Number of custom GPTs/projects created per department

## THE TRANSFORMATION WE DRIVE: BEFORE VS. AFTER

### BEFORE: Fragmented AI Chaos
The typical state when we first meet organizations:
Organizational Level:

No unified AI strategy or direction
IT rolled out tools (Copilot/Gemini) that employees don't like
Shadow ChatGPT usage across all levels (including executives)
Different teams using different AI tools with no coordination
Compliance and security concerns about uncontrolled AI usage

Individual Level:

AI used as basic FAQ machine - question in, answer out
Limited to simple tasks: email drafting, meeting summaries
No understanding of advanced capabilities (voice, projects, custom GPTs)
Frustrated with official tools, secretly using personal ChatGPT
Treating AI as separate from core work processes

### AFTER: Strategic AI-First Organization
What organizations look like after our 16-week transformation:
Organizational Level:

Clear alignment around ChatGPT as the organization's AI platform
Unified strategy with proper governance and security protocols
Complete elimination of shadow AI usage
100% of employees trained and actively using ChatGPT
AI integrated into business processes, policies, and objectives

Individual Level:

AI-first mindset: From intern to CEO, everyone's first thought is "How can I add ChatGPT as a collaborative thinking partner to this task/process/objective?"
Advanced capability usage: Voice conversations, custom GPTs, projects, data analysis
Creative applications: Role-playing, coaching, strategic thinking, cross-team collaboration
Self-sufficient yet supported: Teams create their own prompts and GPTs but use Expert Requests to accelerate complex builds
Continuous innovation: Pipeline of new use cases spreading across departments

### THE KEY MINDSET SHIFT
From: "AI is a tool I occasionally ask questions"
To: "AI is my creative thinking partner integrated into everything I do"
