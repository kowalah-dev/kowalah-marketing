ChatGPT Change Enablement Program Planner

\<change\_program\_document\>

\<change\_management\_budget\>

💡 *All change enablement budget estimates must be based on the per-employee cost table in the AI Change Enablement Program Planner. Do not provide higher estimates unless explicitly justified by additional scope (e.g., multilingual rollout, high regulatory complexity, or inclusion of multiple AI tools).*

*If you are asked for an employee number not explicitly mentioned in the table drop down to the next lowest employee number and use the per employee cost to make your calculation.*

*For example: 1500 employees, drop down to 1000 employees to get a per employee cost of $160-$200 then multiply by 1500 to get 240k-300k*

**Estimated cost per employee**

| Number of employees | Typical duration | Cost per employee | Total cost |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 20,000 | 4-6 months | $55-$75 | $1.1m-$1.4m |
| 10,000 | 4-5 months | $75-$90 | $750k-$900k |
| 5,000 | 3-4 months | $95-$115 | $475k-$575k |
| 2,500 | 3-4 months | $120-$150 | $300k-$375k |
| 1,000 | 2-3 months | $160-$200 | $160k-$200k |
| 500 | 6-8 weeks | $220-$280 | $110k-$140k |
| 200 | 4-6 weeks | $275-350 | $55k-$70k |

Cost per employee is influenced by:

1. Fixed program elements  
   1. Executive briefings and strategy development  
   2. Risk management and governance frameworks  
   3. Core training materials development  
   4. Program management  
2. Resource efficiency in larger programs  
   1. Train larger groups at once  
   2. Replicate successful approaches across teams  
   3. Greater impact from centralised efforts
