# Kowalah Content Strategy

*Created: 2026-02-14*
*Source of truth for content planning. References @.claude/product-marketing-context.md for positioning.*

## Executive Summary

Kowalah's content mirrors its sales motion: **lead with impact, prove through building, scale through transformation**. The site has a strong services foundation (8 service pages) and 34 active Sanity blog posts, but significant gaps in searchable content that captures executives actively looking for AI implementation help.

**Production capacity:** Founder-led, ~2-4 pieces/month.
**Priority:** Searchable content first (capture existing demand), shareable thought leadership layered on top.

---

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: AI Implementation That Delivers
**The core pillar.** This is what Kowalah does differently: embed, build, prove value in weeks.

Captures executives searching for AI implementation help. "AI implementation" and "AI pilot" keywords have strong commercial intent. The competitive landscape (big consultancies, training companies) leaves a gap for the Sprint-based, build-first approach.

**Connection to product:** Every piece leads to the AI Impact Sprint as entry point.

**Topics:**
- Why enterprise AI pilots fail (and the pattern that fixes it) — **HUB ARTICLE**
- The AI Impact Sprint: what it is, how it works, what you get
- Custom GPTs, Claude skills, and AI agents for real business processes
- Expert Requests: why ongoing AI delivery beats one-off projects
- How to measure AI implementation ROI
- Kowalah vs. management consultancies for AI [comparison]

### Pillar 2: Scaling AI Across the Organization
**The transformation pillar.** Once the Sprint proves value, how do you take it organization-wide?

Captures CHRO persona and Change Enablement service. The "Enthusiasm Gap" is a proprietary concept no competitor talks about. "AI change management" is a growing search category.

**Connection to product:** Leads to Change Enablement, AI Training (101/102/201), AI Ambassadors, platform visibility.

**Topics:**
- The Enthusiasm Gap: why AI training creates excitement but not execution — **HUB ARTICLE**
- Building an AI Ambassador network (the Ground Game)
- Shadow AI: turning a security risk into your biggest opportunity
- AI training powered by internal examples (not generic tutorials)
- From Sprint to programme: scaling AI wins across departments
- Kowalah vs. AI training companies [comparison]

### Pillar 3: Industry AI Playbooks
**The specificity pillar.** Shows Kowalah understands your industry, not just AI in general.

"AI for [industry]" searches are high-volume, high-intent. Kowalah targets manufacturing, finance, healthcare, professional services, and retail but has zero industry content. Biggest content gap.

**Connection to product:** Sprint use cases specific to each sector. Links to relevant Accelerators.

**Topics:**
- AI in manufacturing: quality control, predictive maintenance, supply chain
- AI in financial services: compliance workflows, risk assessment, client reporting
- AI in healthcare: admin automation, scheduling, patient coordination
- AI in professional services: document review, client deliverables, research
- AI in retail: inventory, customer experience, demand forecasting

### Pillar 4: AI Tools & Platforms for Business
**The expertise pillar.** Multi-platform knowledge is a key differentiator.

Existing platform pages (Anthropic, OpenAI, Vercel) provide foundation. "ChatGPT vs Claude" and "best AI tools for business" are high-volume with commercial intent.

**Connection to product:** Shows depth of expertise. Leads to Sprint and Expert Requests.

**Topics:**
- ChatGPT Enterprise vs Claude for business [comparison]
- Custom GPTs vs Claude Projects vs Gemini Gems: what to build where
- AI platform evaluation framework for non-technical leaders
- When to use which AI platform (decision tree)
- Google Gemini for enterprise (new platform page)

### Pillar 5: AI Leadership for Business Executives
**The persona pillar.** Speaks to each decision-maker's specific concerns.

CEO and CIO solution pages exist but CFO, CHRO, and business unit leaders don't. Rather than "you need a CAIO," this frames around "how to lead AI transformation in your role."

**Connection to product:** Each role page maps to a persona and connects challenges to Kowalah's services.

**Topics:**
- Solution page: For CFOs (ROI, budget alignment, measurable outcomes)
- Solution page: For CHROs (workforce transformation, change enablement, skills development)
- Solution page: For Business Unit Leaders (department-specific AI via Expert Requests)
- How to build an AI business case for the board
- What "AI-ready" actually means for a mid-sized company

**Webinar multiplier:** Each Wednesday Webinar should become a blog post within its pillar. This could double output without extra writing effort.

---

## Cleanup Required

### Template Content (Delete)
14 files from the SyncMaster theme with no relevance to AI or Kowalah:

**Blog posts** (`src/content/insights/post-1.md` through `post-8.md`):
- "Email Marketing Best Practices," "Optimizing Your Sales Funnel," "Task Management Tips," etc.

**Case studies** (`src/content/case/study-1.md` through `study-6.md`):
- All reference "SyncMaster" as the product.

**Action:** Delete these files. Sanity blog posts are the primary content source. Template files dilute topical authority and undermine credibility.

### Webinar Archive (Medium-term)
Create `/resources/webinars` for Wednesday Webinar recordings with summaries. Each becomes a content asset within its pillar.

## Strategic Principles

1. **Lead with the failure pattern, not the solution.** People search for why their approach isn't working, not for "AI Impact Sprint." Once they understand the failure pattern, the Sprint becomes the obvious answer.

2. **The Enthusiasm Gap is the most shareable asset.** It names something every executive has experienced. Build it standalone, reference it everywhere.

3. **Industry pages serve dual duty.** Rank for searches *and* support sales conversations ("here's what AI looks like in your sector").

4. **Comparison pages capture decision-stage traffic.** Higher conversion rates, direct sales team support.

5. **Mirror the engagement flow.** Pillar 1 → Sprint. Pillar 2 → Change Enablement. Pillar 3 → Sector expertise. Pillar 4 → Platform depth. Pillar 5 → Persona-specific concerns.
