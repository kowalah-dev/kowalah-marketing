# Kowalah - Enterprise AI Deployment, Training & Managed Services

> Kowalah partners with mid-sized enterprises (1,000-10,000 employees) to deploy AI, drive adoption, and deliver measurable business outcomes. We provide AI Impact Sprints, Change Enablement programmes, and ongoing Managed AI Services across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

## What We Do

Kowalah helps organisations move from AI interest to real business impact through three service components:

1. **AI Impact Sprint** (2-3 weeks) - We embed with key stakeholders, identify high-value AI opportunities, and build working solutions (custom GPTs, prompts, workflows) that prove value before scaling.

2. **Change Enablement** (organisation-wide) - Scale AI transformation using Sprint proof points. Includes AI 101/102 training, AI Ambassador networks, governance frameworks, and cultural change management.

3. **Managed AI Services** (ongoing monthly) - Continuous AI value delivery through Expert Requests, Accelerator libraries, strategic guidance, and board-ready reporting. Ideas get built, not stuck in backlogs.

## Who We Serve

Mid-sized organisations (1,000-10,000 employees, $50M-$1B revenue) outside the technology sector who recognise AI as a strategic imperative but lack internal AI leadership expertise. Industries include manufacturing, finance, healthcare, professional services, and retail.

**Decision makers:** CEOs, CIOs, IT Directors, CHROs, and CFOs seeking enterprise AI transformation.

## Platform Expertise

We are platform-agnostic AI specialists with deep expertise across:
- **OpenAI / ChatGPT Enterprise** - Deployment, custom GPTs, API integration
- **Anthropic / Claude** - Enterprise implementation, Claude skills, workflow automation
- **Google Gemini** - Workspace integration, enterprise deployment
- **Microsoft Copilot** - Adoption rescue and optimisation

## Key Differentiators

- **20+ programme elements** spanning strategy, people, technology, and ongoing capability building
- **Proof-first approach** - AI Impact Sprints deliver measurable wins before organisation-wide investment
- **Human-centred transformation** - Every employee guided on their personal AI journey
- **Expert Requests model** - Organisations submit ideas, our specialists build the solutions
- **Multi-platform expertise** - Not locked to a single AI vendor

## Pricing

- **AI Impact Sprint:** $8,000-$50,000 (depending on scope, 1-5 use cases)
- **Change Enablement:** From $160 per employee (complete transformation programme)
- **Managed AI Services:** From $16,000/month (Expert Requests + platform access + strategic guidance)
