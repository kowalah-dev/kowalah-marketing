# Kowalah - ChatGPT Enterprise Deployment & Training Services

> Turn Shadow ChatGPT Usage Into Enterprise-Wide Success

## What We Do

Kowalah specializes in ChatGPT Enterprise deployment, training, and ongoing managed services. We transform organizations struggling with shadow AI usage and failed Copilot/Gemini deployments into successful enterprise-wide ChatGPT adoption.

We provide three core services:

1. **ChatGPT Enterprise Deployment** - Complete technical rollout with governance, security setup, and initial training (6-week implementation)

2. **Change Enablement Program** - Comprehensive workforce transformation from confused users to confident AI collaborators through structured training programs (ChatGPT 101, 102, AI Ambassadors network)

3. **Managed AI Services** - Ongoing strategic guidance with quarterly Expert Requests for custom GPT development, prompt engineering, and continuous capability building

## Who We Serve

**Primary Clients:** Mid-sized organizations (1,000-10,000 employees) facing:
- Shadow ChatGPT usage across departments with no governance
- Stalled Microsoft Copilot or Google Gemini deployments with low adoption
- Need for proper AI governance while giving employees tools they prefer

**Decision Makers:** CEOs, CIOs, IT Directors, and CHROs seeking enterprise AI transformation

## Our Approach

**Not Generic AI Consulting:** We are ChatGPT specialists, not general AI consultants. Our expertise is specifically in ChatGPT Enterprise deployment, advanced capabilities training (voice, custom GPTs, Projects), and organizational change management.

**Human-Centered Transformation:** We guide every employee on their personal journey to AI enlightenment—from shadow usage to confident power users leveraging advanced features most teams never discover.

**Expert Delivery Model:** Organizations identify needs, our specialists build solutions. Teams stay focused on core work while we handle custom GPT development, prompt engineering, and technical implementation.
