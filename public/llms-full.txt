# Kowalah - Enterprise AI Deployment, Training & Managed Services

> Kowalah partners with mid-sized enterprises (1,000-10,000 employees) to deploy AI, drive adoption, and deliver measurable business outcomes. We provide AI Impact Sprints, Change Enablement programmes, and ongoing Managed AI Services across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

## Company Overview

Kowalah is an enterprise AI services company that helps mid-sized organisations (1,000-10,000 employees) move from AI interest to real business impact. We are not a SaaS-only platform or a generic consultancy. We combine hands-on AI implementation, workforce training, and ongoing managed services to deliver measurable outcomes.

Our approach is proof-first: we start with a focused AI Impact Sprint to build real wins, then scale through Change Enablement programmes, and sustain momentum through ongoing Managed AI Services with Expert Requests.

## Core Services

### 1. AI Impact Sprint (2-3 Weeks)

Build real wins with key people before investing in organisation-wide rollout.

**What happens:**
- We embed with 2-3 key stakeholders to understand their actual work
- Identify 1-5 highest-value AI opportunities across the organisation
- Build working solutions: custom GPTs, prompts, workflows, and automations
- Deliver board-ready proof points and internal champions
- Platform expertise across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini

**Pricing:** $8,000-$50,000 depending on scope (1-5 use cases)
- GBP: £6,000-£40,000
- EUR: €6,800-€42,500

**Why it matters:** The Sprint creates internal proof points. When training later includes "Here's what Sarah in Finance built," it's infinitely more powerful than generic tutorials. This proof-first approach de-risks the larger investment.
